## Introductory Remarks: Meaning, Truth, and Truth Conditions

### 	Set Theory

- ***`Set`*** consists of individuals and/or entities. 
- **`=`** is *transitive*, *symmetrical* in every way.
- ***Property of relations***:
  - ***`Transitive`*** If A is a subset of B, and if B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C too.
  - ***Symmetry***: A is a subset of B, **iff** B is a subset of A.
  - ***Reflexive***: 
- ***Binary Operations*** ***`intersection`*** and ***`union`***.
  - If intersection of two sets is an empty set, then it is called ***`disjoint`***
  - If `A` is a subset of `B`, their intersection is `A` and their union is `B`.
- ***Uniory Operations*** ***`complement`*** and ***`power set`***.
  - If complement
  - Power set of A: `S(A) = {B:B⊆A}`
- ***Property of operations***
  - ***Associativity***  `(A∩B)∩C = A∩(B∩C)`
  - ***Distributivity***  `A∩(B∪C) = (A∩B)∪(A∩C)`
  - `A-B = A∩B'`

> *Entailment*: S1 entails S2 = when S1 is true, S2 is true
>
> ​	    *entails*
> S1  *is equivalent to* S2 	   “Snow is white” iff Snow is white
> ​	  *contradicts*			  object language      METALANGUAGE
> S1 *semantically ambiguous*      “Elena’s sister is blonde”

> *Proper Names* (PN): They denote individuals, along with *pronouns*. The *definite descriptions* also denote individuals like “the pope.”
