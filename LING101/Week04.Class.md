## Week 4
# Phonology
### MINIMAL PAIRS
| Word #1       | Word #2      | Language |
|   ---         |   ---        |   ---    |
| `[zɪp] 'zip'` | `[sɪp] 'sip'` | _en._    |
| `[kɑz] 'kaz'` | `[kɑs] 'kas'` | _tr._   |

##### CONCLUSIONS
1. `[k]` and `[s]` are **distinct phonemes** in both Turkish and English.

[ sol ]        | soul   | [ sɛm ]  | fountain     | `#_ɛ`
[ ʃol ]        | shoal  | [ sɛ:m ]  | jealousy    | `#_ɛ:`
[ sip ]        | seep   | [ seda ] |  to count    | `#_e`
[ ʃip ]        | sheep  | [ se:da ]  | string     | `#_e:`
[ mæs ]        | mass   | [ ʃihap ] | game        | `#_i`
[ mæʃ ]        | mash   | [ ʃinho ] | signal      | `#_i`

##### CONCLUSIONS
1. `[s]` and `[ʃ]` are distinct phonemes in English, but not in Korean.
2. Whereas, in Korean, the length of the vowels such as `[e]` and `[ɛ]` are distinct phonemes.
3. In Korean, `[ʃ]` seems to be always followed by `[i]`. Since `[ʃ]` and `[s]` aren not distinct, it would be **ill-formed** to use `*[si]`. `[s]` has **wider distributions**, hence it is called **elsewhere variant**, a **phoneme**.
4. In Korean, `/s/` is a phoneme whose **allophones**** are `[s]` and `[ʃ]`
```
  /s/ --> phoneme
  _|_
 |   |
[s] [ʃ] --> allophones
```

- _* CD => Complementary Distribution_
- _** allophone => allo(gr.) means variant_

### OBSTRUENTS & SONORANTS

| **OBSTRUENTS** | STOPS      | `p b t d k g ʔ`   |
|                | FRICATIVES | `f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ` |
|                | AFFRICATES | `tʃ dʒ`           |
| **SONORANTS**  | NASALS     | `m n ŋ`           |   
|                | LIQUIDS    | `r l`             |
|                | GLIDES     | `j w`             |

##### CONCLUSIONS
1. **Palatalization** in Korean `[i]`. `/s/→[ʃ] / _[i]`
2. Palatalization in British English occurs before **high vowels**. In _tuesday_, `/t/→[tʃ] / _[hv*]`
3. In French, nasal vowels are distinct, whereas in English vowels go under **nasalization** when pronounced before a nasal consonant. `/v/→[ṽ] / _[nc**]`
---
* _* hv => high vowels_
* _** nc => nasal consonants_

### BUNDLE OF FEATURES
- There are features such as `[±voice]`, `[±obstruent]`, `[±stop]`, `[±fricative]`, `[±nasal]` and so on.
- For example `/s/` is `[+obstruent]`, `[-stop]`, `[+alveolar]`, `[-voice]`, and when it becomes `[ʃ]`, `/s/→[+palatal] / _[+front, +high, +tense v]`.
```
     /s/      →    [ʃ]    /   ___[i]            *KOREAN*
|+obst      |
|-stop      |                    |+front |        EASE
|+alveolar  |  |+palatal| /   ___|+high  |         OF
|+voiced    |                    |+tense |    ARTICULATION
```
---

### PHONEMIC VS. PHONETIC
- Japanese word `chichi` is phonemically `/titi/` and phonetically `[tʃitʃi]`.
- Since `[ti]` is not observable in Japanese. So when we see `/ti/`, it is `[tʃi]`

## NOTES
1. Hemen her dilde el ile yapılan eylemlerin aynı zamanda zihinsel eylemlerle bağdaştırılması. _en. grasp, tr. kavramak, elle tutulmak_ 
2. Bunun sebebi, insan dillerinin ses kullanmaya başlamadan önce bir vücut dili oluşturmuş olmasıdır.
3. **Ses**, dilin **modüllerinden** yalnızca birisidir.
4. `/d/→[ð] / v_v` means that `/d/` become `[ð]` in **intervocalic position**. It's in German.
```
          /d/ --> phoneme
          _|_ 
         |   |                      
        [d] [ð] --> allophones
