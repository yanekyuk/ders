# Syntax at class

- hidden / tacit

- Basic things that come to mind when we think of sentences: subject, object, and predicate (verb)

| meaning   | doer    | doee    |           |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| semantic  | agent   | patient |           |
| syntactic | subject | object  | predicate |

- **Back-forming**:  *television* to *televise,* *burglar* to *burgle*, *intuition* to *intuit*

- When it comes to signing, all sign languages prefer SOV order because it's more natural.
