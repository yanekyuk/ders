### CHAPTER 5
# Phonetics: The Sounds of Language
### Summary
- **Phonetics** is the science of speech sounds.
- When we speak, the physical sounds we produce are continuous stretches of sound, which are the physical representations of strings of discrete linguistic **segments**.
- The **major phonetic** in use is the **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**, which includes modified Roman letters and **diacritics**, by means of which the sounds of all human languages can be represented. To distinguish between **orthography (spelling)** and **phonetic transcriptions**, we write the latter between square brackets, as in [fə̃nɛɾɪk] for _phonetic_.
- All speech sounds come from the movement of lung air through the vocal tract. The air moves through the **glottis** (i.e., between the vocal cords), up the pharynx, through the oral (and possibly the nasal) cavity, and out the mouth or nose.
- All speech sounds are either **consonants** or **vowels**, and all consonants are either **obstruents** or **sonorants**. Consonants have some obstruction of the airstream in the vocal tract, and the location of the obstruction defines their **place of articulation**, some of which are: **bilabial**, **labiodental**, **alveolar**, **palatal**, **velar**, **uvular**, and **glotal**.
- Consonant are further classified according to their **manner of articulation**. They may be **voiced** or **voiceless**, **oral** or **nasal**, and long or short. They may be **stops**, **fricatives**, **affricates**, **liquids**, or **glides (affricatives)**. During the production of voiced sounds, the vocal cords are together and vibrating, whereas in voiceless sounds they are apart and not vibrating. Consonants may also be grouped according to certain features to form larger classes such as **labial**, **coronal**, **anterior**, and **sibilant**.
- Vowels form the nucleus of syllables. They differ according to the position of the tongue and lips: high, mid, or low tongue; front, central, or back of the tongue; rounded or unrounded lips. The vowels in English may be **tense** or **lax**. Tense vowels are slightly longer in duration and slightly higher than lax vowels. Vowels may also be **stressed** (longer, higher in pitch, and louder) or **unstressed**. Vowels, like consonants, may be nasal or oral, although most vowels in all languages are oral.
- Length, pitch, loudness, and stress are **prosodic**, or **suprasegmental**, features. In many languages, the pitch or **tone** of the syllable is linguistically significant. Such languages are **tone languages**. There are also **intonation** languages in which the rise and fall of pitch over an entire phrase may affect meaning.
- Differentiation examples:
  - _biru_ [biru], _biiru_ [biːru]
  - _saki_ [saki], _sakki_ [sakːi]
  - **nasalization** => _men_ [mɛ̃n]
