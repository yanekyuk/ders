# Morphology

- Words are important part of linguistic knowledge and constitute a component of our mental grammars, but one can learn thousands of words in a language and still not know the language.

- Knowing a language means knowing the **morphemes** of that language, which are the elemental units that constitute words.

- When you know a word or a morpheme, you know both its **form** (sound and gesture) and its **meaning**; these are inseparable parts of the **linguistic sign**. The relationship between form and meaning is **arbitrary**.

- The mental lexicon specifies the **grammatical category** or **syntactic class** of the words.

- Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverb are the **content words**.

- Content words are sometimes called **open class** words because we can and regularly do add new words to these classes, such as *Facebook* (noun), *blog* (noun, verb), *frack* (verb), *online* (adjective, adverb), and *blingy* (adjective).

- The words that do not have clear lexical meanings or obvious concepts associated with them, including conjunctions such as *and, or,* and *but*; prepositions such as *in* and *of*; the articles *the* and *a/an*, and pronouns such as *it* are called **function words** because they specify grammatical relations and have little or no semantic content.

- Function words are sometimes called **closed class** words. This is because it is difficult to think of any conjunctions, prepositions, or pronouns that have recently entered the language.

- With growth of the feminist movement, some proposals have been made for adding a genderless singular pronoun. If such a pronoun existed, it might have prevented the department head in a large university from making the incongruous statement "We will hire the best person for the job regardless of **his** sex." Various proposals such as "e" have been put forward, but none are likely to gain traction because the closed classes are unreceptive to new membership. Rather, speakers prefer to recruit existing pronouns such as *they* and *their* for this job.

- Count the number of F's in the following text without reading further, then check the result at the bottom*.

  ```
  FINISHED FILES ARE THE
  RESULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC
  STUDY COMBINED WITH THE
  EXPERIENCE OF YEARS.
  ```

- The two classes of words also seem to function differently in **slips of the tongue** produced by normal individuals. For example, a speaker may inadvertently switch words producing "the journal of the editor" instead of "the editor of the journal," but switching or exchanging of function words has not been observed.

# Morphemes

- The linguistics term for the most elemental unit of grammatical form is **morpheme**.
- The study of the internal structure of words, and of the rules by which words are formed, is **morphology**.
- Singers sing and flingers fling, but fingers don't *fing. Because it is a single morpheme, or a **mono-morphemic word**.
- Morphemes may be free or bound. **Free morphemes** stand alone like *girl* or *the*, and they come in two types: **open class**, containing the content words of the language, and **closed class**, containing the function words such as *the* or *of*.
- Some morphemes like *boy, desire, gentle,* and *man* may constitute words by themselves. These are **free morphemes**. Other morphemes like *-ish, -ness, -ly, pre-, trans-,* and *un-* are never words by themselves but are always parts of words. These **affixes** are **bound morphemes** and they mat attach at the beginning, the end, in the middle, or both at the beginning and end of the word.
- Affixes consist of **prefixes**, **suffixes**, and **infixes**.
- Morphologically complex words consist of a morpheme **root** and one or more affixes. When a root morpheme is combined with an affix, it forms a **stem**.

| -        | -                       | -                               |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **root** | Chomsky                 | (proper) noun                   |
| **stem** | Chomsky + ite           | noun + suffix                   |
| **word** | Chomsky + ite + s       | noun + suffix + suffix          |
| **root** | believe                 | verb                            |
| **stem** | believe + able          | verb + suffix                   |
| **word** | un + believe + able     | prefix + verb + suffix          |
| **root** | system                  | noun                            |
| **stem** | system + atic           | noun + suffix                   |
| **stem** | system + atic + al      | noun + suffix + suffix          |
| **word** | system + atic + al + ly | noun + suffix + suffix + suffix |

- There are also **bound roots** such as *-ceive* in  *receive, conceive, perceive,* and *deceive.* 

- Languages have their own **morphological rules**. For instance, using English's rules, one can coin the terms `Adjective + ify => Adjectify`.

- If an affix changes the meaning of a word it is called a **derivational morpheme**. The form that results from the addition of a derivation morpheme is called a **derived word**.

- If not, it is a called an **inflectional morpheme**. These morphemes are **productive**: they apply freely to nearly every appropriate base.

- The grammatical relation of a noun in a sentence is called the **case** of the noun. When case is marked by inflectional morphemes, the process is referred to as **case morphology**.

  | Case           | Indicates                             | Sample case words                        | Interrogative                | *tr*.     |
  | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
  | **Nominative** | Subject of a finite verb              | we                                       | Who or what?                 | Yalın     |
  | **Accusative** | Direct object of a transitive verb    | us, for us, the (object)                 | Whom or what?                | -i hali   |
  | **Dative**     | Indirect object of a verb             | us, to us, to the (object)               | Whom or to what?             | -e hali   |
  | **Ablative**   | Movement *away from*                  | from us                                  | Whence? From where/whom?     | -den hali |
  | **Genitive**   | Possessor of another noun             | 's, of (the), his                        | Whose? From what or what of? | -in hali  |
  | **Locative**   | Location, either physical or temporal | in China, at the bus stop, in the future | Where or wherein? When?      | -de hali  |

- In order to represent the hierarchical organization of words (and sentences), linguists use **tree diagrams**. The tree diagram of *unsystematic* is as follows:

  ```
     Adjective
        /\
       /  \
      un  Adj
         /  \
      Noun  atic
        |
     system
  ```

- This tree represents the application of two morphological rules:

  1. Noun + atic      -> Adjective
  2. un + Adjective   -> Adjective

  ```
        Adv
       /   \
      A    ly
     / \
    A  al
   / \
  un  A
     / \
    N  atic
    |
  system
  ```

- The hierarchical organization of words is even more clearly shown by structurally **ambiguous words**.

  ```
      A        |      A
     / \       |     / \
    un  A      |    V  able
       / \     |   / \
      V  able  |  un  V
      |        |      |
     lock      |     lock
  ```

- **Back-formation** words are the ones derived on the mistaken assumption that `-er` was the agentive suffix. Such as: *peddle, hawk, stoke, swindle, burgle,* and *edit* coming into the language from *peddler, hawker, stoker, swindler, burglar*, and *editor*.

- The meaning of a compound is not always the sum of the meaning of its parts; a *blackboard* may be green or white. A *boathouse* is a house for boats, a *cathouse* is not a house for cats.

# Morphophonology

- English pluralization rule:
  1. Insert a [ə] before the plural morpheme /z/ when a regular noun ends in a **sibilant**, giving [əz].
  2. Change the plural morpheme /z/ to a voiceless [s] when preceded by a voiceless sound. (It's crucial that this rule apply after Rule 1)

| -                         | *bus* + pl. | *butt* + pl. | *bug* + pl. |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Basic Representation      | /bʌs + z/   | /bʌt + z/    | /bʌg + z/   |
| Schwa Insertion (Rule #1) | /bʌs**ə**z/ | n/a          | n/a         |
| Voicing (Rule #2)         | n/a         | /bʌt**z**/   | n/a         |
| Phonetic Representation   | [bʌsəz]     | [bʌts]       | [bʌgz]      |

- English past tense rule:
  1. Insert a [ə] before the past-tense morpheme when a regular verb ends in a non-nasal alveolar stop, giving [əd].
  2. Change the past-tense morpheme to a voiceless [t] when a voiceless sound precedes it.

| -                         | *raid* + past | **hug + past** | reap + past |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Basic Representation      | /red + d/     | /hʌg + d/      | /rip + d/   |
| Schwa Insertion (Rule #1) | /red**ə**d/   | n/a            | n/a         |
| Voicing (Rule #2)         | n/a           | n/a            | /rip + t/   |
| Phonetic Representation   | [red**ə**d]   | [hʌgd]         | [ript]      |

* *Most people come up with three, which is wrong. If you came up with fewer than six, count again, and this time, pay attention to the function word *of*.
