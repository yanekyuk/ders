### Phonological Processes

#### Assimilation

- Assimilation rules in languages reflect **coarticulation**—the spreading of phonetic features either in the anticipation or in the perseveration of articulatory processes.—

- Assimilation is the process in which a sound become similar to a neighboring sound in terms of its phonetic features such as voicing, point of articulation or manner of articulation.
- **Voicing**: *clothe* /klɔθ/, *clothing* /klɔðɪŋ/
- **Devoicing**: *dogs* /dɔgz/, *cats* /kæts/
- **Nasalization**: *sing* /sɪ̃ŋ/
  - **Homorganic Nasal Assimilation**: *impossible* `/ɪmpasəbəl/`, *indefinite* `/ɪndefɪnɪt/`, *incredible* `/ɪŋkredɪbəl/`
- **Palatalization**: *hit you* /hɪt͡ʃjʊ/

#### **Dissimilation**: 

- Dissimilation is a phonological process whereby one segment becomes less like another segment in its environment.

- **Dissimilation Rule**: sixth* /sɪkst/ –after s (frc.) θ (frc.) becomes t (stp.)–

#### Feature Adding Rules

- A phonetic feature is added on the segment in certain environments.
- **Aspiration**: *pill* /pʰɪl/, *spill* /spɪl/

#### Sound Deletion

- A sound is deleted in a morpheme in certain environment.
- **Deletion Rule**: *sokak* /sokak/, *sokağa* /sokaːa/, *crumb* /krʌm/, *crumble* /krʌmbəl/

#### Sound Insertion (epenthesis)

- A process that inserts a sound segment into a particular environment.
- **Epenthesis Rule**: *athlete* /æθlit/ → /æθəlit/, grup /grup/ → /gurup/

#### Metathesis

- A process that reorders a sequence of sound segments.

- **Metathesis Rule**: *kibrit* /kibrit/ → /kirbit/, *asked* /æskt/ → /ækst/

### Historical Linguistics

- Historical linguistics is a sub-branch of linguistics that focuses on **language change through time**.  Its objectives are:

  - How and why languages change over time
  - How and why sound changes occur
  - What kinds of changes occur in morphology and syntax
  - What kinds of changes occur in lexicon
  - How linguists can reconstruct languages spoken in the past based on existing descendant languages

- An example of the nature of language change would be English:

  ```
  And	Seaxan Þa   sige    geslogan
  and Saxons the	victory	won
  «and the Saxons won the victory»
  
  Þa   sendan hi   ham  ærendraccan
  Then sent   they home a messenger
  «Then they sent home a messenger»
  ```

- All languages change and the change is regular and systematic. 

- The causes of language change are as following:

  - **Articulatory Simplification** (ease of articulation)
    - *e.g. fifths* /fɪfθs/ → /fifs/
  - **Spelling Pronunciation**
    - *e.g. often /ɔftən/ → /ɔfən/
  - **Analogy and Reanalysis**
    - *analogy e.g.* `ride : rode = dive : x` → `x = dove`
    - *reanalysis e.g.* *o.e. sarig* meant *sore, painful, sensitive* but under the influence of *o.e. sorh* mening *grief, regret* it gradually changed into *m.e. sorry*
    - *reanalysis e.g. hamburger* `hamburg-er` → `ham-burger`
  - **Language Contact**
    - Borrowing lexical items from languages in contact can lead to sound changes like word initial /v/ in borrowed words from French into English and in contact with other English dialects /f/ and /v/ have become distinct phonemes.
  - **Hypercorrection**
    - *e.g.* `John and I went to the store` → `He saw John and I`

### Morphological and Lexical Changes

#### Derivational Morphemes

- **Addition of affixes**
  - Through borrowing: *e.g. fr.* `commence+ment` → `accomplish+ment`
  - Through derivation: *e.g. OE* `hād` meaning *state, condition, rank* → *me suffix* `hood`

#### Inflectional Morphemes

- **Case Suffixes**

  - *e.g.* English has lost most of these case endings.

    ```
    CASE		OE sng.	OE plr.
    			stone	stones
    nominative	sta:n	sta:nas
    genitive	sta:nes	sta:na
    dative		sta:ne	sta:num
    accusative	sta:n	sta:nas
    ```

  - Only genitive is retained on nouns.

  - Pronouns *his* and *hers* were created after case endings were lost.

- **Agreement Suffixes** `þ = θ or ð`

  - *e.g. OE*

    ```
    ic singe		I sing			we singaþ	we sing
    þu singest		you sing		ge singaþ	you sing
    he/heo singeþ	he/she sings	hie singaþ	they sing
    ```

#### Lexical Changes

- Throughout its history English has not only borrowed words from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst losing some old words.
- **Borrowed Words**: *e.g.* `jungle, cheetah, shampoo, thug, bazaar, khaki, orangutan`
- **Word Coinage**: *e.g.* `Xerox, Tipex, Kleenex`
- **Words from Names**: *e.g.* `Sandwich, Jumbo, Robot, Paparazzi, Google, Frisbee`
- **Calques**: *e.g.* `flea market (marché aux puces), free verse (vers libre), long time no see (hǎo jiǔ bu jiàn)`
- **Blends**: *e.g.* `sitcom, brunch, chillax, motel`
- **Clipping**: *e.g.* `gym`nasium, `prof`essor, `ad`vertisement, `math`ematics
- **Acronyms**: *e.g.* `LASER, URL, GIF, SCUBA`

#### Semantic Changes

- **Broadening**: *e.g.* `holy day, picture, mouse, cookie, virus`
- **Narrowing**: *e.g.* `meat` meant *food*, `flesh` meant *meat*, `hund` meant *dog*
- **Meaning Shifts**: *e.g.* `lust` meant *pleasure*, `immoral` meant *not customary*, `silly` meant *happy* then *naive* now *foolish*, `nice` meant *ignorant*

#### Syntactic Change

- In English, the past tense of the verb *to go* is not *goed* or any other form based on the base *go*, but *went*, a borrowing from the past tense of the verb *to wend* (to traverse).

- **Word Order**: *e.g.* `Hēo hine laerde`, `she him advised` → `she advised him`

  ```
  Nu	loke euerich man toward	himsuelen.
  Now	look every	 man to		himself.
  Now it's for every man to look to himself.
  ```

- **Inversion**: *e.g.* `Speak they the truth?` → `Can they speak the truth?`

#### Borrowing of English

- English lexicon contains a large number of loan words (3/5 of 20k common words)

- **Major lenders**: Latin, Greek, French, Scandinavian

- **5th century**: 3 Germanic tribes move to Britain with their Germanic language which will become English.

- **9th-10th centuries**:  Some Scandinavian tribes raid Britain.

- **11th century**: Normans (French) invade England and French functions as the official, dominant language used in most commercial, cultural and social matters for 300 years.

  ```
  fr.		en.
  mutton	sheep
  pork	pig
  beef	cow
  veal	calf
  venison	deer
  ```

### Sound Changes Through Time

#### Phonological Changes

- Most sound changes begin as subtle alterations in the sound patterns of language in particular phonetic environments. The linguistic processes underlying such phonetically conditioned change are identical to the ones found in the phonology of currently spoken languages.
- **Assimilation**: 
  - **Homorganic Nasal Assimilation**: *early lt.* `inpossibilis` → *later lt.* `impossibilis`, *old sp.* `semda` → *modern sp.* `senda`
  - **Regressive Assimilation**: lt. `septem` → *it.* `sette`,
  - **Progressive Assimilation**: *early oe.* `slæpde` → *late oe.* `slæpte`
  - **Affrication**: *lt.* `kentum` → *it.* `tʃento`
  - **Palatalization**: *lt.* `gentem`  → *old fr.* `ʒent`
- **Dissimilation**:
  - **Adjacent Dissimilation**: *old lt.* `anima` → *lt.* `anma` → *sp.* `alma`
  - **Distance Dissimilation**: *lt.* `arbor` → *sp.* `arbol`
- **Epenthesis**: *old en.* `þunrian` → *en.*`thunder` (∅ → d / n__ ), *lt.* `scribere` → *sp.* `eskribir` (∅ → e / #__s)
- **Metathesis**: *early old en.* `þridda` → *late old en.* `þirdda`, *sp.* `arbol` → *it.* `albero`
- **Reduction & Deletion**: *old en.* `nama` → *middle en.* `namə` → *en.* `neːm`, *lt.* `matures` → *old sp.* `maduro` → *sp.* `maðuro` → *old fr.* `maðyr` → *fr.* `myʀ`

#### Consonants

- **Weakening**: *lt.* `mittere` → *sp.* `meter` → *fr.* mɛtʁ
- **Strengthening**: *lt.* `iuvenis [j]` → *it.* `giovanne [dʒ]`

#### Sound Shifts

- **Great Vowel Shift in English**:

  ```
  tiːd 		iː → aj 	tajd 		"tide"
  luːd 		uː → aw 	lawd 		"loud"
  geːs 		eː → iː 	giːs 		"geese"
  sɛː 		ɛː → iː 	siː 		"sea"
  goːs 		oː → uː 	guːs 		"goose"
  brɔːkən		ɔː → oː 	broːkən 	"broken"
  naːmə 		aː → eː 	neːm 		"name"
  ```

  - **Major Periods of English**

    ```
    English			Period			Significant Event
    Old English		up to 1100		1066 Norman Conquest
    Middle English	1100-1500		1476 Caxton's Printing Press
    Late English	1350-1500		Great Vowel Shift
    Modern English	1500-present	1564 Birth of Shakespeare
    ```

  - It affected only the long vowels of English.

  - It evolved in several steps although the exact timing and routes of the change are difficult to ascertain.

  - The reasons are not clear either.

- **Consonant Shifts**

  - *e.g.* A consonant shift took place between Proto Indo-European and Proto-German.

  - **Grimm's Law** describes this shift involving stops and fricatives.

  - **Werner's Law** explains exceptions to Grimm's Law. Proto-Germanic voiceless fricatives became voiced when occurring between voiced sounds if the immediate preceding vowel was not accented in Proto-Indo-European.

    ```
    bʰ →  b    dʰ →  d    gʰ →  g
    b  →  p    d  →  t    g  →  k
    p  →  f    t  →  θ    k  →  h
    ```

### Language Contact

#### Lingua Franca

- A common language that people who come from different language background use in communication with each other.
- Examples: English in Nigeria, Singapore, India
- English for International business, science, technology, aviation, and maritime.
- Lingua franca serves the referential function of the language. Because it is spoken for specific purposes.
- Referential is a measure of the amount of information being shared in a discourse. The use of facts, statistics, directions, etc. 
- Affective relates to the emotional content of communication and indicates how someone feels about the topic.

```
Referential vs. affective
Affective: Günaydın => "Gün" doesn't have to be "aydın".
```

#### Pidgin

- Pidgins tend to become Lingua francas because they develop in response to a need for an LF typically for economic purposes.
- Common features:
  - Pidgins are formed when features of at least two languages combine in such a way that:
    - the language of the more powerful group provides the lexicon -> lexifier / superstratum
    - The language of the less powerful group provides the rest **further info needen
- Pidgins are no one's first language. Their users are multilingual.
- Pidgins are language of business and trade, Not of home and family
- Pidgins begin typically with **a jargon phase**
- When they get more standard grammatical features with less individual variation they reach **stable pidgin phase**
- As they come to be used in more contexts, they reach the **extended pidgin phase**.

#### Creole

- A language varieties that develops out of a pidgin in a language contact situation.

- Spoken as a first language of some speakers.

- Used in an entire set of social settings.

- ```Tok Pisin (New Guinea)
  Gras	mousgras		gras bilong fes
  Tu buk	digyal place	buk bilong yu
  
  Baimbai	 	hed		bilongyu	i-arrait	gain
  by and by	head	belong you	be-allright	again
  'your head will soon get well again'
  
  di gyal place 'the girl's place'
  No possessive pronouns, instead 'bilong' is used
  ```

- With the passage of time, creaoles ed up co-existing with a variety of their lexifier language.

- In contrast to creolization process, now, the speakers who have greater contact with a standard variety of the language through *e.g. education, refrain from using creole*.

- Where education and greater social prestige are associated with a "higher" varieties, a number of speakers will tend to use fewer creole forms and structures -> decreolization

- Multiple levels of creole can develop -> **post-creole continuum**

  - **Basilect**: Most creole like variety "a fi mi buk dat"
  - **Mesolect**: Intermediate variety between basilect and acrolect "is mi buk"
  - **Acrolect**: the least creole like or most standard / prestigious variety "it's my book"

- **Linguistic repertoire**

#### Multilingualism

- The standard language
  - An idealized variety
  - Not associated with any particular region
  - Associated with education and broadcasting
- **Accent**: aspects of pronunciation that identify where a speaker is from regionally or socially.
- **Dialect**: features of grammar and vocabulary as well as phonological features. _i.e. American, Canadian, British, Australian English_

- **Language**: can be thought of as a collection of dialects that are usually linguistically similar, used by different social groups who choose to say that they are speakers of one language which functions to unite and represent them to other groups. 

  > A language is a dialect with an army and a navy. Max Weinreich

- **Dialectology**:

  - Mutual intelligibility is the criterion typically used to distinguish a dialect and a language.
  - Dialect surveys to identify consistent features of speech found in one geographical area compared to another.
  - [Informants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant_(linguistics)): NORMS (*non-mobile, old, rural, man speaker*)
    - Non-mobile speakers are good informants because they are more isolated in language. (old, local, rural)
    - Men are preferred to be informants.
  - Isogloss
    - ![img](https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/mf_image_16x9/public/You-Map_6.png?itok=SZA_UdGG)
    - Isoglosses overlap in their borders. 

##### Multilingual Societies

- Around the world, **Multilingualism** is the **norm** in the world, **monolingualism** is an exception. Multilingual growing up in communities where multilingualism is the norm are more likely to see the boundaries between languages as fluid. They may acquire bare functional competence in many additional languages or not really worry about what level of ability is required to be considered competent in a language.
- Research on multilingual societies lead to a reconceptualization of what it means to be native speaker.
- A person may learn several languages from birth but that person may associate with one language in some contexts of use and with other languages in other contexts of use.

###### Diaglossia

- A situation in which two distinct languages varieties co-exist in a speech community acting as social registers in which the high variety is used in formal situations and the low variety among friends.
- Diglossia is a characteristic of speech communities rather than individuals
- The choice of language is highly constrained by the social context of use **domain** and these constraints are fairly similar across diglossic situations.
- Ex. Messing (2007) Mexicano (Nahtual) - Spanish bilingualism in central Mexico.
  - Spanish is considered a public language, thus hight valued for use in public context such as public meetings and school.
  - Spanish is lowly valued in personal speech.

###### Domains of language use

- Ex. guarani and spanish in Paraguay

  | domain         | addressee | setting        | topic                     | language |
  | -------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
  | family         | parent    | home           | planning a party          | guarani  |
  | friendship     | friend    | cafe           | funny anectode            | guarani  |
  | religion       | priest    | church         | choosing liturgy          | spanish  |
  | education      | teacher   | primary school | telling a story           | guarani  |
  | education      | lecturer  | university     | solving a math problem    | spanish  |
  | administration | official  | office         | getting an import licence | spanish  |

  

#### Code Switching

- Two or more languages (or dialects) spoken interchangeably by the interactants in the same text whether spoken or written.
- Code-switching is an interactional resource in multilingual contexts that allows multilingual people to most readily build relationships and mutual understanding in interaction.
- **Situational code-switching**: domain based switch
- **Metaphorical code-switching**: used as a sociolinguistic resource
- **Difference between borrowing and code-switching**:
  - **Borrowing**: I love biscottis with my coffee. (biscotti is plural form of biscuit in Italian.)
  - **CD**: I love biscotti with my coffee.
