### English Vowels

#### Lexical Sets

A lexical set is a group of words that share a similar phonological feature. The lexical set system provides information about the three important parameters of accent variation in English vowels: (1)  the number of **phonological vowel categories** in an accent is indicated by the number of distinct vowel symbols in each column, (2) the **phonetic vowel qualities** in an accent is given by the IPA symbols in each column, and (3) the **distribution of vowels** in the lexicon is given by overlapping and intersecting word sets.

| Lexicon | American | British | Description                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| TRAP    | æ        | æ       | —                           |
| BATH    | æ        | ɑː      | Difference in distribution. |
| LOT     | ɑ        | ɒ       | Difference in quality.      |

British and American English have the number of vowels, thus they have the **same vowel system**. 

Both accents have the same number of vowel contrasts (the same vowel systems), but they use /æ/ and /ɑ/ in different words, thus they have **difference in distribution**.

In the words "mate" and "might", Cockney will have vowels best represented as [ʌɪ] and [ɑɪ], Estuary English pronounces these words with [ɛɪ] and [ʌɪ], thus they have **difference in vowel quality**.

#### Unstressed Syllables

In all forms of English, the symbol [ə] may be used to specify a range of mid-central vowel qualities. The symbol [ə] is often produced when vowels have a central, **reduced vowel** quality. A vowel can have **stressed** (full form), **unstressed** (and unreduced), and **reduced **form.

| Vowel | Stressed Syllable | Unstressed Syllable | Reduced Syllable |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| i     | appr**e**ciate    | cr**e**ation        | depr**e**cate    |

It is important to recognize that these lexical correspondences are the result of **diachronic processes** of sound change rather than the result of a **synchronic process** of phonetic reduction. *i.e.* The schwa in "along" is the vowel target that speakers intend to reach, it is not a phonetically reduced version of an underlying full vowel.

> Synchrony and diachrony are two different and complementary viewpoints in linguistic analysis. A **synchronic approach** (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time **without taking its history into account**. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a **diachronic approach** (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") **considers the development and evolution of a language through history**. Historical linguistics is typically a diachronic study.

#### Tense and Lax Vowels

The vowels of English can be divided into what may be called **tense** and **lax** sets which behave differently in English words (again diachronic, not directly related to the tenseness of the muscles in mouth). The tense vowels [eː] occur in the words such as *mate, mete, kite, cute* with so-called silent *e* in the end, whereas the lax vowels [ɛ] occur in words without silent *e*: *mat, met, kit, cut*.

For the **distribution of tense and lax vowels in English**, it can be said that **in closed syllables** (ending with a consonant) both forms can occur. *i.e. beat* [biːt], *bit* [bɪt] Whereas in **open syllables**, only a restricted set of vowels (tense) can occur. *i.e.* *bee* [biː], *boo* [buː].

Best way to visualize the tense and the lax vowels are to think of them as groups: [i, ɪ], [eɪ, ɛ], [u, ʊ], and for British [ɑ, ɒ].

Some contrasts:

- Before [ ŋ ], it is the lax vowels that usually occur.
- Before [ ʃ ], it is the lax vowels that usually occur.

#### English Vowel Allophones

Listing some observations:

1. Other things being equal, a given vowel is longest in an open syllable, next longest in a syllable closed by a voiced consonant, and shortest in a syllable closed by a voiceless consonant.

   > [i] is longer in "bee" than it is in "been", than it is in "beet", than it is in "bit"

2. Other things being equal, vowels are longer in stressed syllables.

   > [oʊ] is longer in "below" than it is in "billow"

3. Other things being equal, vowels are longest in monosyllabic words, next longest in words with two syllables, and shortest in words with more than two syllables.

   > [i] in "speed" is longer than it is in "speedy" than it is in "speedily"

4. A reduced vowel may be voiceless after a voiceless stop (and before a voiceless stop).

   > *i.e. p**o**tato, c**a**tastrophe*

5. Vowels are nasalized in syllables closed by a nasal consonant.

   > m**a**n

6. Vowels are retracted before syllable final [ ɫ ].

   > /i/ in "heed" [hiːd] vs. "heel" [hiʊɫ]

   Some speakers also have vowel retraction before /r/ as in *hear*, *there* which might be [hiəɹ] and [ðeəɹ].

### English Words and Sentences

#### Words in Connected Speech

Speech is not composed of series of distinct gestures and we don't usually speak using isolated words. The form of a word that occurs when you say it by itself is called the **citation form**. But in connected speech, many changes occur. Closed-class words such as determines (*a, an, the*), conjunctions (*and, or*), and prepositions (*of, in, with*)—the grammatical words— are very rarely emphasized in connected speech. Closed-class words show a **strong form**, which occurs when the word is emphasized, as in sentences such as *He wanted pie and ice cream, not pie **or** ice cream.* There is also a **weak form**(s), which occurs when the word is in an unstressed position. After a word ending alveolar consonant, most speakers of English have a tendency to drop the vowel and say [n̩] or [n̩d] in phrases such as *cat and dog* or *his and hers*. Another example would be [ðə] *the man* becoming [ðɨ] *the old woman* before vowels. Similar examples also occur at word boundaries such as *on the* [ɒn̪ ðiː] the [n] is dentalized before the dental fricative [ð]. When one sound is changed into another because of the influence of a neighboring sound, there is said to be a process of **assimilation**. *it is* [ɪt ɪz] becomes *it's* [ɪts].

#### Stress

The most reliable thing for a listener to detect is that a stressed syllable  frequently has a longer vowel that it would have if it were unstressed. But this is not the case, as in such examples *cupcake* and *hit man* where stress is in the first syllable but the long vowels are the last syllables. So, the best way to decide whether a syllable is stressed is to try to tap out the beat as a word is said. This is because it is always easier to produce one increase in muscular activity—a tap—in time with an existing increase in activity. Stress has several functions such as:

1. To give special emphasis to a word / contrast one word to another.

   > 'John or 'Mary should 'go.
   >
   > 'I think 'John '**and** 'Mary should 'go.

2. To indicate syntactic category.

   > 'insult (*n.*) vs. in'sult (*v.*)

3. To differentiate a two-word phrase from a compound.

   > 'pushover vs. 'push 'over

#### Degrees of Stress

In some longer words, it may seem as if there is more than one stressed syllable. For example, say the word *multiplication* and try to tap on the stressed syllables. *'multipli'cation*.

#### Sentence Rhythm

The stresses that occur on words sometimes become modified when the words are part of sentences. The words that have stress in their initial syllable may be pronounced without stress in a sentence. *'Mary's younger 'brother wanted 'fifty chocolate 'peanuts.* This is because stress in English tend not to come too closer to each other. *'Vice-president 'Jones* vs. *'Jones, the vice-'president*. It's even okay to say that stresses tend to recur at regular intervals.

#### Intonation

The intonation of a sentence is its pattern of pitch changes. The part of a sentence over which a particular pattern extends is called an **intonational phrase**. Phonetic transcription of the intonation contour is market with starred tones (**H***) on prominent pitch accents, and percent tones (**L%**) marking the tones at the boundary of the phrase. Within an intonational phrase, stressed syllables usually have a pitch change; but there is also a single syllable that stands out because it carries the major pitch change. This syllable, which carries the **tonic accent**, will be marked in this section by an asterisk (*****). The tonic accent usually occurs on the last stressed syllable in a tone group in neutral intonation if you don't intend to put any special focus on any of the words in the utterance. But in short: **intonation is predictable (if you are a mind reader)**. Things to know:

- Questions that can be answered by *yes* or *no*  usually have a rising intonation.
- Usually, in an intonational phrase, the last stressed syllable that conveys a new information is the tonic syllable.
- Questions beginning with a question word—*where, what*, etc.— usually habe a falling pitch.

### Airstream Mechanisms and Phonation Types

All English sounds are initiated by the action of lung air going outward; other languages may use additional ways of producing an airstream.

#### Airstream Mechanisms

Air coming out of lungs is the source of power in nearly all speech sounds. When lung air is pushed out, we say that there is a **pulmonic airstream mechanism**. Stops that use only an egressive, or outward-moving, pulmonic airstream are called **plosives**. 

An upward movement of the closed glottis will move this air out of the mouth. A downward movement of the closed glottis will cause air to be sucked into the mouth. When either of these actions occurs, there is said to be a **glottalic airstream mechanism**. Stops made with a glottalic egressive airstream mechanism are called **ejectives**. The diacritic of it is [ **'** ]. The sequence of events that occurs in a glottalic egressive velar stop [k']:

1. Back of the tongue comes up to form velar closure and the closure of glottis.
2. Closed glottis is raised
3. Body of air in pharynx is compressed
4. Back of the tongue is lowered, releasing compressed pharynx air
5. Glottal closure is released

**Fricative ejectives exist**! **VOT is more in ejectives than in plosives (or pulmonic fricatives)!** 

It is also possible to use a downward movement of the larynx to suck air inward. Stops made with an ingressive glottalic airstream mechanism are called **implosives**. In the production of implosives, the downward-moving larynx is not usually completely closed. The air in the lungs is still being pushed out, and some of it passes between the vocal folds, keeping them in motion so that the sound is **voiced**. The sequence of events that occurs in a glottalic ingressive bilabial stop [ɓ]:

1. Closure of the lips
2. Downward movement of vibrating glottis. Air from the lungs continues to flow through the glottis 
   - Causes reduction in air pressure but it is leaks, so not much of change in pressure.
3. Little change in pressure of the air in the oral tract
4. Lips come apart.
   - At this point, air may be sucked or not, the real defining features are the complex changes in the shape of the vocal tract and in the vibratory pattern of the vocal folds

**Pulmonic voiced stops have a longer voice bar that the glottalic ingressive stops. Glottalic one's voice bar grows louder over time, whereas pulmonic one's decreases.**

One other airstream mechanism is used in few languages. This is the mechanism that is used in producing **clicks**, such as the interjection expressing disapproval that novelists write *tuttut* or *tsktsk*. Movement of the body of air in the mouth called a **velaric airstream mechanism**. clicks are stops made with an ingressive velaric airstream mechanisms. It is also possible to use this mechanism to cause the airstream to flow outward by raising the tongue and squeezing the contained body of air, but this latter possibility is not actually used in any known language. The sequence of events in a dental click [|]:

1. Back of the tongue raised to form velar closure, tongue tip up to form front closure
2. While both the anterior and the velar closure are maintained, the body of the tongue moves down, decreasing the pressure of the air in the front part of the mouth
3. Tongue tip lowered so that air rushed into the mouth
4. Velar closure released

| Glottalic | ingressive | downward movement of the vibrating glottis; pulmonic egressive airstream may also be involved | implosive     | ɓ ɗ ɠ       | usually voiced by the pulmonic airstream                     |
| Velaric   | ingressive | mouth air rarefied by the backward and downward movement of the tongue | click         | ʘ ǀ ǃ ǂ ǁ   | combine with the pulmonic airstream for voiced or voiceless velar nasals |

#### States of the Glottis

There are four states of the glottis: voiced, voiceless, breathy (murmur), and creaky voice.  They all depend on the movements of the **arytenoid cartillages**.

Intervocalic [h] in English is a breathy voice [ɦ].  Breathiness is show by diacritic [ ̤ ].

In **creaky voice**, the arytenoid cartillages are tightly together so that the vocal folds can vibrate only at the anterior end. They are also called **laryngealized**.
