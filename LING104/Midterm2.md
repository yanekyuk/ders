### English Vowels

#### Lexical Sets

A lexical set is a group of words that share a similar phonological feature. The lexical set system provides information about the three important parameters of accent variation in English vowels: (1)  the number of **phonological vowel categories** in an accent is indicated by the number of distinct vowel symbols in each column, (2) the **phonetic vowel qualities** in an accent is given by the IPA symbols in each column, and (3) the **distribution of vowels** in the lexicon is given by overlapping and intersecting word sets.

| Lexicon | American | British | Description                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| TRAP    | æ        | æ       | —                           |
| BATH    | æ        | ɑː      | Difference in distribution. |
| LOT     | ɑ        | ɒ       | Difference in quality.      |

British and American English have the number of vowels, thus they have the **same vowel system**. 

Both accents have the same number of vowel contrasts (the same vowel systems), but they use /æ/ and /ɑ/ in different words, thus they have **difference in distribution**.

In the words "mate" and "might", Cockney will have vowels best represented as [ʌɪ] and [ɑɪ], Estuary English pronounces these words with [ɛɪ] and [ʌɪ], thus they have **difference in vowel quality**.

#### Unstressed Syllables

In all forms of English, the symbol [ə] may be used to specify a range of mid-central vowel qualities. The symbol [ə] is often produced when vowels have a central, **reduced vowel** quality. A vowel can have **stressed** (full form), **unstressed** (and unreduced), and **reduced **form.

| Vowel | Stressed Syllable | Unstressed Syllable | Reduced Syllable |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| i     | appr**e**ciate    | cr**e**ation        | depr**e**cate    |

It is important to recognize that these lexical correspondences are the result of **diachronic processes** of sound change rather than the result of a **synchronic process** of phonetic reduction. *i.e.* The schwa in "along" is the vowel target that speakers intend to reach, it is not a phonetically reduced version of an underlying full vowel.

> Synchrony and diachrony are two different and complementary viewpoints in linguistic analysis. A **synchronic approach** (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time **without taking its history into account**. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a **diachronic approach** (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") **considers the development and evolution of a language through history**. Historical linguistics is typically a diachronic study.

#### Tense and Lax Vowels

The vowels of English can be divided into what may be called **tense** and **lax** sets which behave differently in English words (again diachronic, not directly related to the tenseness of the muscles in mouth). The tense vowels [eː] occur in the words such as *mate, mete, kite, cute* with so-called silent *e* in the end, whereas the lax vowels [ɛ] occur in words without silent *e*: *mat, met, kit, cut*.

For the **distribution of tense and lax vowels in English**, it can be said that **in closed syllables** (ending with a consonant) both forms can occur. *i.e. beat* [biːt], *bit* [bɪt] Whereas in **open syllables**, only a restricted set of vowels (tense) can occur. *i.e.* *bee* [biː], *boo* [buː].

Best way to visualize the tense and the lax vowels are to think of them as groups: [i, ɪ], [eɪ, ɛ], [u, ʊ], and for British [ɑ, ɒ].

Some contrasts:

- Before [ ŋ ], it is the lax vowels that usually occur.
- Before [ ʃ ], it is the lax vowels that usually occur.

#### English Vowel Allophones

Listing some observations:

1. Other things being equal, a given vowel is longest in an open syllable, next longest in a syllable closed by a voiced consonant, and shortest in a syllable closed by a voiceless consonant.

   > [i] is longer in "bee" than it is in "been", than it is in "beet", than it is in "bit"

2. Other things being equal, vowels are longer in stressed syllables.

   > [oʊ] is longer in "below" than it is in "billow"

3. Other things being equal, vowels are longest in monosyllabic words, next longest in words with two syllables, and shortest in words with more than two syllables.

   > [i] in "speed" is longer than it is in "speedy" than it is in "speedily"

4. A reduced vowel may be voiceless after a voiceless stop (and before a voiceless stop).

   > *i.e. p**o**tato, c**a**tastrophe*

5. Vowels are nasalized in syllables closed by a nasal consonant.

   > m**a**n

6. Vowels are retracted before syllable final [ ɫ ].

   > /i/ in "heed" [hiːd] vs. "heel" [hiʊɫ]

   Some speakers also have vowel retraction before /r/ as in *hear*, *there* which might be [hiəɹ] and [ðeəɹ].
