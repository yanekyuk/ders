### Articulation and Acoustics

- The speech mechanism consists of four main components:
  1. **Airstream process** is the air that is pushed out of lungs.
  2. **Phonation process** is the state of **larynx**, with the help of the airstream process, defining whether a sound is voiced or not.
  3. **Oro-Nasal process** is the state of **velic closure** deciding whether a sound is nasal or not.
  4. **Articulatory process** is the rest of the parameters such as **place** and **manner**.
- Speech sounds, in acoustic terms, differ from each other in three ways:
  1. Pitch / Frequency
  2. Amplitude / Loudness
  3. Quality

- Terms describing consonants are ordered as followed:
  1. Voicing
  2. Place of Articulation
  3. Laterality
  4. Nasality
  5. Manner of Articulation
- Acoustic properties of consonants are represented in **waveforms** and **spectrograms**.
  - **Waveform** is the two-dimensional representation of acoustic properties of sounds. It represents **time** and **amplitude**.
  - **Spectrogram** is the three-dimensional representation of acoustic properties of sounds. It represents **time**, **amplitude**, and **frequency**.
- Terms describing vowels are as followed:
  1. Front / Back
  2. High / Low
  3. Rounding

### Phonology and Phonetic Transcription

- There are three types of distribution:

  1. **Contrasive**: When the phonemes in question are distinct. *e.g.* **/p/ to /b/**
  2. **Complementary**: When an allophone of a phoneme is expected in a specific environment. *e.g.* **/l/ → [ɫ]**
  3. **Free Variation**: When an allophone of a phoneme is used arbitrarily. *e.g.* **[hʌtʰ]** vs. **[hʌt̚]** or 

- There are two types of transcription:

  1. **Broad**
  2. **Narrow**

- Things to know:

  - **/i/** is a phonemic or a broad transcription of the sound **[iː]**

  - A broad transcription of the word `please` and `trip` would be **/pliz/** and **/trɪp/**, a narrow transcription would be **[pl̻iːz]** and **[tɹ̻ɪp]**. So **approximants are devoiced after a voiceless stop**.

  - **Consonants are dentalized before a dental fricative.** The words `tenth` and `width` are transcripted broadly as **/tɛnθ/** and **/wɪdð/**, narrowly as **[tɛn̪θ]** and **[wɪd̪ð]**.

  - **When /l/ occurs at the end of a syllable the body of the tongue is raised in the mouth.** So, the words `feel` and `pill`  in broad transcription **/fil/** and **/pɪl/** becomes **[fiːɫ]** and **[pʰɪɫ]**.

  - Differences between vowels used in British English and American English are as followed:

    | British English | American English | Gloss                       |
    | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
    | ɒ               | ɑ                | h**o**t, h**o**d            |
    | əʊ              | oʊ               | h**oe**d, c**o**de          |
    | ɜ               | ɚ                | h**er**d, h**er**, b**ir**d |
    | ɪə              | ɪɹ               | h**air**, c**are**d         |
    | aə              | aɪɹ              | h**ire**d                   |

  - The ligature symbol is used to tie symbols together. `white shoes` being **[waɪtʃuːz]** and `why choose` being **[waɪt͡ʃuːz]**.

###  The Consonants of English

- Things to know:
  - **Voiceless stops** in syllabic start position become **aspirated**. `pie` and `tie` would be narrowly transcribed as **[pʰaɪ]** and **[tʰaɪ]**.
  - Words such as `spy`, `sky`, and `skill` if recorded and their sibilants removed from them would sound like **[baɪ]**, **[gaɪ]**, and **[gɪɫ]**, 
  - Words such as `nab` and `cad`, if pronounced without aspiration at the end, are still clearly distinct from `nap` and `cat` . That is because **vowels before voiced consonants are longer than the vowels before voiceless consonants**. This is called **co-articulation** meaning that each unit of sounds affect each other.
  - On the other hand, **a voiceless stop after a vowel is longer than a voiced stop**. This is how they make up for the time lost for the lack of lengthening of vowel.
  - In words such as `apt` and `act` , the `p` and `b` sounds become unreleased. In a narrow transcription, they would be represented as **[æp̚t]** and **[æk̚t]**. This is a pattern that is exclusive to English. For instance, a caricaturization of an Italian would say `It's a bigga day` instead of `It's a big day`. In narrow transcription, **[ɪts ə ˈbɪg̚ ˈdeɪ]** and **[ɪts ə ˈbɪgᵊ ˈdeɪ]**.
  - **Glottal stop** is a distinct phoneme in English. *e.g.* **[ˈʔʌʔʌ]** means `no`, whereas **[ˈʌhʌ]** means `yes`.
  - When **a stop is followed by a homorganic nasal, nasal plosion occurs**.  Words such as `hidden` and `sudden`, would be pronounced as **[hɪdn̩]** and **[sʌdn̩]**. What is more is, words such as `open` and `captain` would go into homorganic nasal assimilation and then would be pronounced as **[ˈoʊpm̩]** and **[ˈkæpm̩]**
  - A similar phenomenon, **lateral plosion** may take place when an **alveolar stop occurs before homorganic lateral approximant**, for example the words `little` and `ladle` are pronounces as **[ˈlɪtl̩]** and **[ˈleɪdl̩]**.
  - In American English, **alveolar stops become taps in intervocalic position**. This rendering themselves unable to distinguish between words such as `writer` and `rider`, transcribed as **[ˈɹaɪɾɚ]** and **[ˈɹaɪɾɚ]**. In Canada, although they tap too, they preserve the phoneme's quality in the vowel, so what they say would distinguishable, transcribed as **[ˈɹəɪɾɚ]** and **[ˈɹaːɪɾɚ]**.
  - Fricatives tend to change their voicing according to their environment. For instance; in `prove it`, `prove to`, and `try to improve` the `v` sounds would be heard as `v`, `f`, and `f` consecutively. 
  - Approximants such as `w`, `ɹ`, `j`, and `l`, if they are after a voiceless stop, they become voiceless. Such as in the words `play`, `twice` and `clay`, in a narrow transcription they would be **[pl̥eɪ]**, **[tw̥aɪs]**, and **[kl̥eɪ]**.
  - At the end of words or before consonants, there is a considerable difference in how lateral approximant is pronounced. Such as in the words `leaf` and `feel`, the lateral approximant become velar. In a narrow transcription, they would be **[liːf]**, and **[fiːɫ]**. In this case, since the lateral approximant no longer makes contact with the alveolar ridge, instead of alveolar consonant, we would say that it is a **vocalized /l/**.
