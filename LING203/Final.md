## Auxiliaries and Functional Categories

### Tense, Aspect, Mood/Modality (& Voice)

**Perfectives** … Ex. *He ran*

Habitual is presented as *perfective*.

**Perfect** need a reference time along with event time and speech time.

`...continuing`

**Aspect** is different than **tense**. It is about how does a speaker present the event.

**Auxiliaries** vs. **participles**

> He *is* <u>running</u>	/	It *is* <u>biting</u><br>He *has* <u>run</u>		/	It *has* <u>bitten</u> <br>	 <small>{tense}</small> <small>{aspect}</small>			 <small>{aspect}</small><br>	 <small>{person}</small>
>
> *it.* Aux  (lexically deficient)<br><u>ul.</u> participles  (inflected verbs that are lexical )
>
> He *runs*	/ 	He *bites*		<small>{present} {imperfective} {person}</small>
>
> Participles can function as adjectives makers and passive makers

#### Modals vs. Auxiliaries

> The have broken the silence twice.
>
> The criminal had been being interrogated for 3 hours when the phone rang.

**Perfect / Passive Participle** = V<sub>3</sub>

**Modals**: *can, may, might, etc.* Modals don’t get inflected as same as the other. *You should see a doctor* doesn’t really mean that *should* is past. They are nor inflected for person. Modals require a bare form of a verb.

**Auxiliaries**: They require a participle form from the verb.
