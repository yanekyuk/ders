### Overview of the Course & Introduction

- There some sort of representation of grammar in our mind that generated language. We don’t know what that system looks like. Theoretical linguistics deal with that. We look at the output of the system and make guesses about the system that produces it. Those guesses usually end up as theory and they are modified through decades.

> 1950’s “Syntactic Structures” (1957)
> Artificial Intelligence
> Aim at developing a model of the way the language is represented in the mind. This model should be able to generate the sentences that are possible (grammatical) and not generate those that are not possible.

- **Transformational Grammar (TG)** is the idea that the different sentence types are the transformations of each other. Active / passive. Question / declarative.
- **Transformational Generative Grammar**
- **Standard Theory**
- **Extended Standard Theory**
- **Government & Binding (GB) - Principles & Parameters (P&P)**
- **Minimalist Program (MP)**
- **Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG)**
- **Head Driver Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)**
