#### Rousseau, Formation of Civil Society and the Idea of Inequality

- **Rousseau** is a major controversial philosopher of the Enlightenment. He signed his books as **citizen of Geneva** that it he had right to vote in Geneva. Immigrants in the city were called **inhabitants** and their lineage **natives** and they didn't have the suffrage.
  - **Kant** regarded Rousseau as "the Newton of the moral world." In contrast, **Voltaire**, "No one has ever employed so much intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is seized with a desire to walk on four paws. However, as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit, I feel, unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to resume it."
- **The Encyclopédie** was a general encyclopedia published in France around 1700s. It represented the thought of Enlightenment. Its aim was to **change the way people think**.
  - **Objective**: To summarize and bring to a large public philosophical, scientific, and technological knowledge (the source of Adam Smith's pin-making manufacture)
  - Rousseau had many entries on music and the one on economy.
- **First Discourse** (*Discourse on the Sciences and Arts*), is Rousseau's first successful published philosophical work in which he argued that the arts and sciences corrupt human morality. 
- **The Enlightenment**: Rousseau, Kant, Smith
  - **Enlightened use of reason** to uncover the principles of a good government, morality, and social order.
  - **A cultural project**: concerned effort to write for **a broad audience** (in contrast to 17th century scholars). Prize essay contest.
  - **Birth of a "public sphere"** (see Kant's public use of reason and the enlightened public in *What is Enlightenment?*)
- **Second Discourse** (*Discourse on Inequality*), is an investigation through reason of humanity prior to reason, an enlightened attack on enlightenment and civilized society, "perfectibility" of mankind: progress of reason does not lead to a better humanity, an Epicurean account of the intreaction of humans and nature.
- **What is man?**
  - "**Origin**" (in the state of nature): empirical study of man vs. a historical and timeless nature or essence of man
  - "**Foundations**" (in civil society): "law of property and of inequality, changed adroid usurpation into irrevocable right"
- **Philosophical anthropology**:
  - To denaturalize / de-essentialize man (three stages of the state of nature)
    - **First Stage**: man in a primitive stage: isolated, no language, no family, no reason, no love. **First revolution**: the socialization of men
    - **Second Stage**: development of families (love and jealousy), nations and quasi-property (progression of huts). The best period. **Second Revolution**: Agriculture and metallurgy
    - **Third Stage**: division of land, division of labor and (final stage) invention of property (state of war)
  - To demostrate the radical disjunction between the "savage man" and the "civilized man"
  - To demonstrate that reason and sociability are not natural (i.e. not to be found in an early stage of the state of nature)
  - To demonstrate that inequality "derives its force and growth from the development of our faculties and the progress of the human mind, and eventually becomes stable and legitimate through the establishment of property and laws"
- **Two kinds of Inequality**:
  - **Natural or Physical Inequality**:
    - "established by nature"
    - "age, health, bodily strength, and qualities of mind or soul"
  - **Moral or Political Inequality**:
    - "instituted by convention" and "authorized by consent of men"
    - Privileges (richer, more honored, more powerful). Not **meritocratic**.
    - Servitude of the poorer and the weaker
  - There are no "**essential connection**" between the two.

#### Kant, The Idea of Enlightenment

- Overview of the Enlightenment

  - **Begins**: Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* in his *Discourse on the Method* (1637) / Death of *Louis XIV* in 1715.
  - **End**: French revolution in 1789 / Napoleonic Wars in 1804.
  - A cultural, intellectual, literary,and philosophical movement which promoted rational thinking and a broad circuladigitation of knowledge.
    - Calls for a shift from a position of fear, a servitude to dogma, to an individual, intellectual emancipation.
    - Aims to surpass the obscurantism of the political and religious ideas of the past and promotes and disseminate knowledge.
    - Facilitated by progress made in the printing press and by the progressive transition from publications in Latin to vernacular languages like English, French, and German.

- **Kant's definition**:

  - "Enlightenment is mankind's **exit** from its self-incurred **immaturity**." (58)

  - **True Reform**: Emancipation from "the guidance of another", one will have "to work himself out" of it. It only required "courage".

    - If no freedom, risk of a revolution.

    - A public can achieve enlightenment gradually. A revolution may perhaps bring about the fall of an autocratic despotism and of an avaricious or overbearing oppression, but it can never bring about.

    - The true reform of a way of thinking. Rather, new prejudices will serve, like the old, as the leading strings of the thoughtless masses.

    - Its **necessary condition** is **freedom**.

      > For this enlightenment, however, nothing more is required than *freedom*; [...] the freedom to make a public use of one's reason **in all matters**. (59)
      >
      > ---
      >
      > the *public* use of reason must at all times be free, and it alone can bring about enlightenment among men; the *private* use of reason, however, may often be very narrowly restricted without the **progress of enlightenment** being particularly hindered. I understand, however, under the public use of his own reason, that use which anyone makes of it *as a scholar* before the entire public of the *reading world* (59-60)

      - **Private use**: As a part of the machine, the individual has to obey to the rules imposed by his civil post and fulfill his duties so that he does not disturb the commonwealth.
      - **Public use**: but as a scholar, as someone who is knowledgeable about something, the individual should be completely free to express his opinion.
      - Fine balance between obedience for the sake of the accomplishment of civil duties and freedom for the sake of progress in society.

- **Political and historical context**:

  - "This age is the age of enlightenment or the century of *Frederick*" (62)
    - *Frederick William I, the Soldier King*, austere and militaristic lifestyle, devout Calvinist, rigid management of the treasury, never started a war, at his death in 1740, full treasury and sound economy
  - *Louis XIV* as the model of absolutist power. "Reason of state", *i.e.* the idea that national interest should prevail in order to strengthen and assert the state nationally and internationally.

- **Reasons of concentrating on Religion**:

  - **Historical reasons**: Kant was looking back on 250 years of violent religious debates and oppositions which led to the worst conflicts humanity faced.
  - **Philosophical Reason**: it is part of the freedom of the individual to believe.
  - **Pragmatic and Strategic Reason**: Frederick II was known as the champion of religious tolerance => speaking about religion as a safe way to speak about the use of reason "in all matters"

- **Engine and a fundamental condition for progress**:

  - "When nature has, under this hard shell, developed the seed for which she cares most tenderly-namely, the inclination and the vocation for *free thinking* -this works back upon the character of the people (who thereby become more and more capable of *acting freely*) and **finally even on the principles of government**, which finds it to its advantage to treat man, who is now *more than a machine*, in accord with his dignity." (63)
  - Enlightenment is mentioned as the engine and fundamental conditions for progress towards the "**civic union of the human race**."
  - In a teleological approach, Kant defends the idea that the history of humanity as a whole has a goal which is the establishment of a unrealized ideal cosmopolitan state through the use of reason and the general spreading of Enlightenment "**Nature's secret plan to bring forth a perfectly constituted state**."
  - “**Enlightenment comes gradually**, with intermittent folly and caprice, **as a great good which must finally save men from the selfish aggrandizement of their masters**, always assuming that the latter know their own interest. This enlightenment, and with it a certain commitment of heart which the enlightened man cannot fail to make to the good he clearly understands, **must step by step ascend the throne and influence the principles of government**.”

- **Conclusion**:

  - Kant gives a definition of a historical, intellectual and philosophical movement of the 18th century.
  - Paves the way for progress of mankind throughout history.
  - Enlightenment = before everything an emancipation that will eventually lead to the constitution of better states which will be morally funded and anchored in the rule of law.
  - Enlightened absolutism is nothing else but a transitory phase in the process towards republicanism (= separation of executive and judicative for Kant)

#### Music, Orientalism and Exoticism

- **Orientalism** *noun*: 1. Style, artifacts, or trait considered characteristic of the peoples and cultures of Asia. 1.1. The representation of Asia in a stereotypes way that is regarded as embodying a colonialist attitude. *Oxford Dictionaries*. Western ideas about the Middle East and about East and Southeast Asia, especially ideas that are too simple or not accurate about these societies being mysterious, never changing, or not able to develop in a modern way without Western help. *Cambridge Dictionary*

- **Edward Said**

  > The Orient has helped to define Europe as its contrasting image, idea, personality, experience.
  >
  > ---
  >
  > …the orientalist, poet or scholar, makes the Orient speak, describes the Orient, renders its mysteries plain for and to the West. He is never concerned with the Orient except as the first cause of what he says. What he says and writes, by virtue of the fact that it is said or written, is meant to indicate that the Orientalist is outside the Orient, both as an existential and as a moral fact.
  >
  > ---
  >
  > The European, whose sensibility tours the Orient, is a watcher, never involved, always detached, always ready for…bizarre jouissance.

- **Alla turca / Janissary style**:
  - Use of percussion instruments -cymbals, triangle, bass drum, and the piccolo flute
  - Loud playing in full orchestration
  - Duple meter -usually 2/4
  - Rapid tempo
  - Basic harmony
  - Sudden shifting from one tonal area to another
  - Quick melodic decorations
- Over the centuries the image of the Ottoman shifted in music according to the prevailing political and cultural situation:
  - In previous centuries, when the Turks had represented a real danger to certain European countries, their reception swung from fear, hatred to admiration.
  - Under the influence of the Enlightenment, the "Oriental" was invested with qualities such as goodness, tolerance, and strength of faith.
  - The characterization as quasi barbarian became increasingly redundant during the course of the 19th century, as the turks became an ally of European powers and as the Ottoman sought to modernize and Westernize itself.

#### Adam smith, The Industrial Revolution and the Market Economy

- By 1750, England has the strongest, most productive market economy in the world.

- By 1750, almost **everyone depends on exchange** to live from day to day. People produce for the market, and they depend on market exchange (buying and selling) to get what they need.

- It is a competitive market. Workers compete for work. Producers compete to produce for less cost.

- Capitalist production—a capitalist economy— was already well established in England, before Smith and before the Industrial Revolution.

- What is wealth?

  > The annual **labour** of every nation is the **fund** (source) which **supplies** it with all **the necesssaries and conveniences** of life **which (the nation)** annually **consumes**, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of its labour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.

  - Labour creates the things we need and use
  - The things we need and use are wealth. We consume wealth. We consume what labour creates.

- Why are some nations wealthier than others?

  - The skill, dexterity, and judgment with which labor is applied (in other words, how things are produces; the techniques of making things)

  - The proportion of those people who do useful work (who make useful things—commodities) and those who do not produce useful things.

  - Which is more important?

    - How something is produced?

      > Among the savage nations of hunters and fishers everyone who is able to work is employed in useful labour. But such nations are **so poor** that they must sometimes destroy or **abandon their infants and old people and the sick** leaving them  to perish of hunger or be devoured by wild beasts.

      by contrast

      > Among civilized and thriving nations, **although  a great number of people do not labour at all** … yet the produce of the whole labour of the society is so great that **all are often abundantly supplied**, and the working man if he is **frugal** and **industrious**, may enjoy more necessities and conveniences of life than any savage.

      and the winner is…

      > The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour … seem to have been the effects of **the division of labour**.

      but keep in mind that

      > The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, … generally becomes **as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become**.

- Nature :arrow_forward: exchange :arrow_forward: division of labour :arrow_forward: progress 

  - **Progress is nature, therefor morally good**.
- **The Industrial Revolution** (1780-1900):
  - In the beginning, work is done by skilled craftsmen, at their homes or workshops, according to their own hours, with their own tools. The merchant buys the goods by the piece, by the amount.
  - After it becomes **the factories**. In which; workers do not own the tools for producing, workers must go to the factory—where machines and wage workers are combined in one place—, workers work for fixed hours–they do not control how they work or how fast they work, they must work according to the speed and the needs of the machine–, workers work for a wage (by **clock time**, not by amount of product or quality of the product)

#### Hegel, Self-Consciousness and the Idea of Self

> Self-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.

**Descartes:** "I am, I exist" :arrow_right: "I am therefore, speaking precisely, only a thinking thing, that is, a mind, or a soul, or an intellect, or a reason."

**Hegel**: We are, we exist through each other. :arrow_right: We are social beings. Our being includes a demand for universal recognition of all by all.

- The first individual: **simple being-for-self** :arrow_right: Risks life in struggle for recognition with another: **pure being-for-self** :arrow_right: Unequal recognition: the lord **being-for-self** who enjoys, the bondsman **being-for-another** who works in return becomes conscious of what he truly is.

#### Rodenbach, Bruges-La-Morte

- It was serialized in French newspaper *Le Figaro*.
- **Symbolism, Decadentism, Fin-de-Siecle**: Particularly influential in Belgium and France. A "return" to Romanticism.
- **Symbolism !== Allegory**: Symbolism seeks the general in the particular and it remais "infinitely active and unreachable."
- A **nature morte** is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which are either natural (food, flowers, dead animals, plants, rocks, shells, etc.) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, etc.).
- A **culture morte** is a work of art depicting cities.

#### "Lives of the Artists", Vasari, 1550

> Renaissance, perspective, humanism, conceptual (vs. symbolism), realism (vs. divine)

**Era** Renaissance, European Reformation

**People** *Cimabue*, *Giotto*, *Brunelleschi*

**Nature** Starting from Giotto, Renaissance artists followed Ancient Greeks' lead and saw the perfection in Nature. They became keen observers and learned from Nature. `realism in renaissance art` `imitation of nature`

**Art** *Vasari*, in this text, underlines the lack of progress until Renaissance by making an example of *Cimabue*'s art and its comparison to his (Cimabue) pupil *Giotto*. *Giotto*, who imitated nature probably because of his shepherd background, is responsible for the advancement (realism) in arts (*i.e.* Giotto, one day, draws a fly on Cimabue's painting, when Cimabue sees it, he tries to shoo it). Through this advancement, the artists gained social power (*i.e.* Giotto declines Mr. Nobody's offer of painting his shield his coat-of-arms).Finally, he mentions *Brunelleschi*, who did come up with a mathematical basis for linear perspective and by doing that revived the art of architecture. `perspective, realism`

**Religion** Painting religious murals was the source of income for artists before and in the beginning of Renaissance. *Cimabue* was a renowned artist in this field but his pupil *Giotto* surpassed him. As a result of Giotto's works, later artists started to draw religious figures more human-like (*i.e.* naked baby Jesus).

#### "On Cannibals", Montaigne, 1580

>Noble Savage, cultural relativism

**Era** Renaissance, European Reformation

**People** Tupinambá, discovered by Portuguese in Brazil which was on the Portuguese part of Americas according to the Treaty of Tordesillas

**Otherness** Natives are the other in this text. Montaigne makes a point that instead of judging "the other", one can try to understand. 

**Civilization** Critique of Eurocentric knowledge: evaluating others' customs through one's own custom. He points out that people in Europe can act barbarously for reasons such as difference in religion. On the other hand, the natives have valor in war and love for wives in common with "civilized" societies.

**Dialectic** The native people of Tupinamba fight with each other not for land or resources but for glory. They prefer to be eaten rather than accepting the superiority of the other.

**Inequality** Natives question the child ordering and old man.

**Religion** Montaigne is able to say "Polygamy is better than monogamy" which is forbidden by church.

**Credibility**  This essay is one of first examples of such manner of honest writing. He says there were two questions but he forgot one, so he will at least talk about that one.

#### "The Merchant of Venice", Shakespeare, ~1596

>Antisemitism

**Era** European Reformation, Elizabethan Era

**People** *Antonio*, *Shylock*, *Portia*, *Bassanio*

**Otherness** *Shylock*

**Wealth** Multiple source of wealth: inheritance (Portia), trade (Antonio), interest (Shylock)

**Inequality** Antisemitism was popular during the time this text was written. All through the story Shylock, the Jew moneylender was excluded because of his religion. This "hatred of other" is applicable to both sides.

#### "Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany", Galileo, 1615

>Heliocentrism, Copernicanism

**Era** ~End of European Reformation and ~start of Age of Enlightenment

**Ideas** Religion vs. scientific truth

**Nature** Nature as immutable source of <small>scientific</small> truth

**Knowledge** of nature vs. theology (church censorship)

**Religion** He points out that religion tells people how one can go to heaven, not how the heaven goes.

**Censorship** He states that banning has no limit; that is, if one feels free to ban the things that seem against the religion, one can ban the books, ban the people from looking at the sky, or even ban some passages in Bible itself. Censorship cannot stop the truth. 

#### "Meditations on First Philosophy", Descartes, 1641

> Certainty of True Knowledge

**Era** Age of Enlightenment

**Self** As a Cartesian philosopher, he makes the distinction of mind and body. Self-contained "I" `cogito ergo sum`

**Knowledge** Only the certainty of the self (dualism of mind and body—Cartesianism—)

**Reason** Use of reason vs. sense perceptions

---

#### "Discourse on Inequality", Rousseau, 1755

> Physical Inequality vs. Moral Inequality, Noble Savage, Counter-Enlightenment

**Era** Age of Enlightenment

**Identity** The Caribs

**Self** *amour-de-soi* vs. *amour-propre*, self preservation as natural right

**Civilization**  Rousseau thinks of civilization as corrupted, blaming the private property which prevents people from enjoying the fruits of the world.

**Human Nature** Changing the nature of men vs. essence of men

**Reason** No reason in the early stage of nature. 

**Inequality**  He distinguished the inequality into two categories: Physical, natural inequality, which is present in the first stage of nature, and moral, conventional inequality, which is artificially created by humans lately.

**Freedom** Original freedom as human nature vs. civilization as dependence and domination

#### "Wealth of Nations", Adam Smith, 1776

> Division of Labour, Source of Wealth

**Era** Age of Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, American Revolution

**Self** Self-interest as human nature–origin of division of labour—

**Civilization** He marks the civilized nations with the presence of division of labour. He also points out that in savage nations, although everyone is occupied with useful labour, because of the general poorness of the nation, people who are unable to work are left to die. On the other hand, in civilized nations, although many don't labour at all, there is still abundance.

**Human Nature** Trade, barter, and exchange as human nature `homo economicus`

**Wealth**  According to him, wealth's source is labour. How this labour is used matters greatly. For more wealth, more division of labour is required.

**Labour** He points out the useful labour, in which people create surplus value. 

#### "What is Enlightenment?", Immanuel Kant, 1784

> Immaturity

**Era** Age of Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution

**Self** Self-incurred immaturity vs. free thinking

**Human Nature** To Kant, Enlightenment is part of human nature. Humans are naturally free thinkers. They only learned not to do so by society.

**Knowledge** Kant says *sapere* *aude*, *dare to know*. It takes courage to know.

**Freedom** According to Kant, people's self-incurred immaturity held them back from freedom. They depended on other's guidance. They were not able to think for themselves. In order to change this, he proposes that **public use of reason** should be legitimized for scholars. If they had the means of criticizing, they could educate people to a point where they are no more immature. On the other hand, **private use of reason** should be obedient to their public limitations, otherwise there would be chaos. Another example would be Frederick the Great, who was titled **enlightened despot**, said **argue as you like, but obey**.

**Progress** To Kant, revolution only brings more prejudices. He is a fan of slow but fundamental progress in mind.

#### "Phenomenology of Spirit", Hegel, 1807

> Master-Bondsman

**Era** Industrial Revolution, <small>after French Revolution</small>

**Otherness** Two self-consciousness facing each other, bondsman

**Identity** The bondsman

**Self** Struggle for recognition

**Inequality** Struggle for recognition, master and slave

**Freedom** Master-Slave dialectic

---

#### "Beauties of Bosphorus", Julia Pardoe, 1838

> Slave trade, Istanbul, Orientalism

**Era** Age of Reflection (Romanticism), Victorian Era

**Otherness** This text is very similar to Montaigne's *On Cannibals* regarding the relativist viewpoint of the author. She defends the culture in Istanbul through the eyes of a European.

#### "Bruges-La-Morte", Rodenbach, 1892

> Symbolist novel (realist symbolism), modernist novel

**Era** Victorian Era

**People** Hugh Viane, Jane

**Identity** The dead wife vs. Jane

**Women** The dead wife has less identity than the city. The dead wife has no name. The dead wife is objectified, Hugh seems to miss the dead wife's physical being, rather than her person.

**Symbolism** The dead wife, Hugh, and the City are symbols for each other. All of them were previously more alive (literally or metaphorically), then dead. The city also symbolizes the struggle and suffering of Hugh Viane.
