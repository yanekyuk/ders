#### "Manifesto of the Communist Party", Marx & Engels, 1848

```
bourgeoisie, proleteriat, alienation, labour, capital, production, industry, unions, class consciousness, revolution, globalization
```

**Progress, Revolution**: In the continuum of progress, there is always going to be a point of revolution because of the requirement of exponential growth . Progress is inevitable. For Marx, time line of progress consists of four stages that "each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in th common ruin of the contending classes": 

1. Tribal Communes: starting with settlements. These starting times are not explained thoroughly by Marx but through the passage from these times to the feudal time the roman society is explained to show the existence of social classes all through the history of humankind.
2. Feudal Societies: starting with agricultural revolution. Burghers as the not so influential bourgeoisie of the time
3. Bourgeoisie: starting with industrial revolution, colonization and free-trade. Bourgeoisie as a revolutionary class.
4. Proletariat: going to start with proletariat revolution. First, they need to gain class consciousness by forming unions and using mass communication that is now available.

**Alienation**: Bourgeoisie owns the capital (means of production), which with the labour can turn into value and then profit. But the labour is the proletariat and it's not the one who gets to profit. The proletariat is alienated from the value of his labour.

**Globalization**: "The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must enable nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere."

#### "The Origin of Species", Darwin, 1859

```
natural selection, variation, artifical selection, struggle for life, exponential growth, destruction and creation, survival of the fittest, inequality, fertility
```

**Progress, Natural Selection**: The fittest get to live and those who get to live breed and those who get to breed make up the population which requires more resource. When resources are not enough, progress is halted. The survivors' variations pass to the next generation.

**Non-anthropocentrism**: The Origin of Species diminishes the sets a framework to explain nature and natural life which we as humans are part of. 

**Social Darwinism**: The idea of natural selection then was modified to humans as artificial selection in which people sought to improve human race by eliminating the so-called the inferior (eugenics, Nazis)

#### "The Souls of Black Folk", Du Bois, 1903

```
emancipation, slavery, double consciousness, veil, race consciousness, segregation, color line, being a problem, strife
```

**Emancipation**: from slavery didn't solve the the African-Americans' problems. They're still discriminated against. Du Bois argues that to emancipate themselves from this discrimination, they have accept their double consciousness of being American and Black at the same time.

**Alienation**: The black folk is alienated. That's because of their strife for being accepted as Americans, while trying to forget their heritage.

> One ever feels his twoness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder. The History of the American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.

#### "Women's Suffrage and Class Struggle", Luxemburg, 1912

```
proletariat, bourgeoisie, right to vote, women, class struggle, class consciousness, gender consciousness, female emancipation, union, domestic production, socialism, social development
```

**Progress, social development**:  Luxemburg sees progress as social development and her view is gaining rights of women (especially proletariat women). The bourgeois women's "only social function is to be tools of the natural propagation of the ruling classes." They're not economically independent as the proletariat women. The proletariat women's economic independence comes from their contribution to the household economy like raising children. This is not seen as productive in the capitalist sense because there is no imminent profit and "seeing this brutal reality clearly and sharply is the proletarian woman's first task". 

**Right to vote**: Luxemburg thinks women should have the right to vote because:

1. Already involved in politics.
2. Women also produce and contribute to the economy contrary to the capitalist
3. Women are also exploited, they're part of the proletariat.
4. Therefore, right to vote is seen as a tool for proletarian revolution. 

#### "On Primitive Art", Emil Nolde, 1912

```
primitive art, anonymity, love of creating, simple forms, museums, power and life, absolute originality, greeks, with hands
```

**Inequality**: between tribal forms of art and western arts. We've seen western art as ideal, condescending the primitive and the anonymous creations, but no mo'.

#### "Neo-Primitivism", Shevchenko, 1912

```fetlb
primitive art, peasantry, physical nature, industry, oriental, Lubok, harmony in simplicity, art as fiction; nature as reality, folklore, Asiatic origin, russia, orient, occident, Lubok
```

**Alienation**: Through industrialism, "physical nature no longer exists." In an attempt to escape the factories' domination the neo-primitivists turn their gaze upon the orient. "Robot-like, we have become habituated to life."

**Beauty**: in the primitive.

#### "A Room of One's Own", Woolf, 1929

```
women, emancipation, Judith, Shakespeare, fact and fiction, Trevelyan, observation, first-wave feminism, right of education, freedom in society, individuality, a room of one's self, active opposition against women, veil
```

**Du Bois**: They shared similar goals, one for black the other women. Du Bois combated the idea of blacks being intellectually inferior, and Woolf the idea of women being intellectually inferior. Du Bois made contrast between the American and the African, whereas Woolf did the same with women and the writer. The approach they took different though. Du Bois utilized quite traditionally Western-style, whereas Woolf used stream of consciousness technique which is a Modernist style that rejected tradition.

**Women & Writing**: For Woolf, the reasons there are no women authors are that they have no money, no opportunity to observe, no room of one's self, no freedom in society, domestic duties, no education, no individuality, and the active opposition against them. Her solutions are: not to imitate man, to become an individual, to do things for one's self, to actively work to change the society, to encourage women.

**Judith**: She makes use of her and her story to convey the reasons and solutions for women's submission. Judith commits suicide in the end, as does Woolf.

> Anonymity runs in their blood. The desire to be veiled still possesses them.

#### "The Drowned and the Saved", Levi, 1947

```
Auschwitz, dehumanization, salvation, perdutition, Mussellman, Nazi, selfishness, giving up morality, survival of the fittest, artificial selection, prominents, genocide, holocaust, shoah, loneliness
```

**Darwin**: Even though Levi and Darwin both talk about a struggle to survive, in Levi's work this struggle is constant. Also, for Darwin natural selection is long process, whereas in Levi's experience this artificial selection is quick. Also, there is no reproduction and evolution. 

**Schepschel, Alfrel, Elias, and Henry**: Schepschel is dancer schebeck who is a man of arts & crafts. Alfren is  a dorky engineer who knows to look good, not to complain, and sells his rations to stay alive. He also acts like a prominent to be one. Elias is manly man who is also a jack of all trades, master of thievery. Henry is a smart, linguaphile who knows how to talk and raise pity in everyone.

#### "The Anthropocene", Steffen, 2007

```
anthropocene, peak oil, holocene, earth system, planetary stewardship, climate change
```

**Marx**: He argued that need of constant growth in capitalist economy would bring about its end, and then a revolution. But this catastrophe now surfaces as climate change which is not economical but environmental. Yet both of the texts argued that its not possible to grow together.

**Darwin**: There is similarity in Darwin's idea of exponential growth's eventual stop due to lack of resources to the article's take on exponential growth. He couldn't foresee the devastation of nature as a cause of extinction for humans.

**Men vs. Nature**: 

#### "Home", Shire, 2014

```
refugee, fear, boats, belonging, go home, survival
```



#### "Kissing in Vietnamese", Vuong, 2014

**Shire**: In Shire's poem Home, home is physical place, whereas Vuong talks about home as lost memories and nostalgia. Yet these memories are disturbing. 

#### "Five Measures of Expatriation", Capildeo, 2016

```

```

Through expatriation, you get to keep your identity to yourself.
