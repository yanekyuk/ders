#### On the Nature of Things

##### Lucretius

> Keywords: Venus, reproduction, Mars, nature of the gods, nature of the soul, obscure matters, divine intervention, first beginnings, first bodies, particles, going astray from reasoning, swerve

###### Book I

Lucretius starts off the poem by praising Venus, since she is responsible of all the beauty in the world and reproduction. On the second page, though, he continues with saying that the Gods are not in need for us, thus separated from our concerns. After that he reveals that he is going to write about **the beginnings of things**, how nature creates, increases, and maintains everything until it dissolves and perishes the same things. The first beginnings include **matter, the seed of things, and first bodies**. Then he **praises Epicurus** for his courage to talk against religion using his intellect. He defends his work by pointing out that **religion also has produced criminal and unholy actions** and even made great evils seem advisable. Then he points out that **nobody knows the actual nature of the soul**. He continues with quoting Epicurus with some addition **nothing ever comes to be from nothing through divine intervention**. He elaborates this quote with that people tend to imagine divine interventions when they face activities they're unable to understand, thus if we see that **nothing can be created from nothing**, **we will more correctly perceive what we are after**. In these parts, he also remarks that religion fills people with fear. Later in Book I, he points out that **nature dissolves each things back into its particles and does not destroy things into nothing**.

###### Book II

He starts off with emphasizing the delightfulness of peace and wisdom over wealth and mastery. He points out that in **this little span of time** nature cries out to us to seek pleasure. He argues that things that do not benefit the body, wouldn't benefit the mind neither. According to him, people are afraid of things in light that are not ought to be more feared that a child's fear of darkness.  **Therefore this fear of mind must be shattered apart not by the rays of the sun (god) but by the external appearance and inner law of nature**. Later he continues with that **the sum of things is seen to remain safe**, meaning that all things die out and with their atoms a new thing emerges. **Some races increase, others are diminished**. **First beginnings never stop**. Then he gives the example that the dust particles swerving in the air which are visible when sunlight hits a dark corner of a house are great to observe the motion of first beginnings. Also, light is slower than the first beginnings, and heat is even more slower. Then he proceeds to argue against the idea that the world was created for humans. [FILL HERE ABOUT GRAVITY]. He explains some inconsistencies regarding the gravity with the random swerve of the first bodies being sometimes completely undetermined. Finally, for the sake of free will, he argues against determinism [EXPLAIN HOW].

###### Book III

He begins the final section of Book III with an another Epicurus quote with addition **therefore death is nothing to us nor does it concern us at all**. Because for him, we consist of our body and soul's combination. When body is no more, soul is no more too. We shouldn't concern ourselves with what we will not be able to experience. Also, **that these same seeds out of which we are now made have been arranged before in the same order as they are now. Nor nevertheless can we recover this with our remembering mind.** Then he points out that if people were able to keep that in mind they wouldn't bother themselves in vain thinking about after death.

#### The Georgics

##### Virgil

> Keywords: F*cking beeeees!, Venus, self-sacrifice, loyalty, virtue, metaphor, legacy, Aristaeus, 

###### The Bees

Book 4 describes bee-keeping, treating the bees with affectionate irony as exemplars of the ideal citizen body (“little Romans”). The work ends with an account of Aristaeus (a minor god, credited with the discovery of bee-keeping), together with the story of Orpheus and his attempt to rescue Eurydice from the underworld. On *p. 124, lines 3-7* and *p. 129, lines 154-57* he points out bees' characteristics as being selfless and dedicated to the common good.  On *p.130, lines 197-202*, he describes bees' reproduction happening **without copulation, and to supply their king**. On *p. 131, lines 203-207*, he praises them for being self-sacrificing for the next generation by **keeping their stock immortal. ** On *p. 131, lines 213-218*, he states that none of these would be possible without the presence of their king, that **he is the guardian of all their work**. Later he continues with rumors that bees possibly **possess a share of the divine mind** and elaborates how they, **when hurt, sacrifice themselves to fight back, thus their rage being boundless**. 

###### Aristaeus

Text continues with the story of Aristaeus, introducer of the cultivation of bees and the vine and olive, protector of herdsmen and hunters.  Aristaeus, after losing his bees, descends to the home of his mother, the nymph Cyrene, where he is given instructions on how to restore his colonies. He must capture the seer, Proteus, and force him to reveal which divine spirit he angered and how to restore his bee colonies. After binding Proteus (who changes into many forms to no avail), Aristaeus is told by the seer that he angered the nymphs by causing the death of the nymph Eurydice, wife of Orpheus. Proteus describes the descent of Orpheus into the underworld to retrieve Eurydice, the backward look that caused her return to Tartarus, and at last Orpheus' death at the hands of the Ciconian women. Book four concludes with an eight-line sphragis or seal in which Virgil contrasts his life of poetry with that of Octavian the general.

#### Metamorphoses

##### Ovid

> Keywords: Metamorphoses, Bodies, Nature *wilderness*, hunting, self *identity*, speech 

###### Invocation

Ovid, in Book 1, declares that his **mind turns to stories of bodies changed into new forms**, and will talk about these stories.

###### Apollo and Daphne

This is a story about a master bowman Apollo and the master bowman Cupid, former disses latter, in return Cupid hits Apollo and Daphne with his arrows, successively with a sharp golden arrow and a blunt lead arrow causing Apollo to fall in love and Daphne to run away from love. This situation is similar to a hunt, in this case Apollo is the hunter (ironically a game for Cupid) and Daphne the game. And yet again ironically the god of herbs and art, Apollo, cannot cure love with his means. The hope causes Apollo to chase Daphne, who is running in fear, and that fear in return transforms her into a laurel tree. That doesn't stop Apollo from embracing Daphne even in her new form, laurel tree. Consequently he declares laurel leaves as the crown and the symbol of Roman kings, symbolizing their glory, thus giving Daphne immortality through art and symbolism.

###### Diana and Actaeon

Before narrating the story, Ovid first asks the question **what sin is there in error?** The story begins with Actaeon, while hunting with his company, accidentally witnessing Diana naked. Diana, in turn, curses him to transform to a beast which is a deer. Although his form becomes of a beast, his self stays intact but unable to express his identity through speech. After him roaming around the woods for some time, his fellow hunters and the hounds detect him, and chase him, and catch him, and execute him while they're wondering his whereabouts. Whereas Diana was satisfied only after his death.

#### City of God

##### Augustine

> Keywords:  pride, original sin, will, city of god, city of men

###### Book I

Book I starts with some explanation regarding the sack of Rome. He criticizes the pagans who attribute the sack of Rome to Christianity despite being saved by taking refuge in Christian churches. He presents the contrast between city of Men and God, but additionally stating that in that era **those two cities are interwoven and intermixed, and await separation at the last judgment**. He ends the first book with declaring that he will **enhance the glory of the City of God** in the rest of the book.

###### Book II

Book II generally consists of criticism towards pagan religion for its immorality, inconsistency, non-clarity.  Although pagans believed that men have free will, Augustine points out that this free will should be accompanied by clear instructions on the way to virtue. For Augustine, a God should have an absolute moral good. What is the point of Greek and Roman Gods? For the lack of these instructions, he criticizes pagan rituals as **demonic** and calls them **antics of madmen**. He compares Greek and Roman take on comedia, former being consistent in attitude and liberal generally, latter being inconsistent and prohibitive regarding praise and maligning any living man. Also, it was allowed in ancient Greece that both human and god can be a subject in these comics, whereas Romans limited it to the gods.

###### Book XIV

Book XIV is mainly about teachings on the original sin as the cause for future lust and shame as a just punishment for lust. Thanks to God, Adam's original sin will not involve every human's everlasting death. Thanks to Adam and Eve, we were **rewarded with death (mortality)**. Then he states his opinion that no matter the variety of customs, languages, arms, and dresses, **it is still true that there have come into being only main divisions: the city of man and the city of god**. These mean **living "by the standard of man" and "by the standard of God"** and also he gives the example that **Devil was also guilty of the same thing, because instead of living by the standard of God, he lived by the standard of an angel**. For God has said "I am the Truth", whoever not living by the standard of it, **he lives by the standard of falsehood**. Hence every sin is a falsehood and when humans try to **increase their welfare, or for the avoidance of misfortune by an act of will**, they do it for the sake of the welfare of the flesh, thus it concludes in misfortune as a sin. Then he clarifies a terminology by St Paul who employed the term "animal" to the same people whom he here calls "carnal". Because *anima* (the soul) and *caro* (the flesh) are parts of a man in his entirety. Then he contemplates about the emotions of the first human beings before their sin: concluding it by saying it was an unfortunate event that they have sinned. **They were not distressed by any agitations of the mind, nor pained by any disorders of the body. They lived in a partnership of unalloyed felicity.** **The good will is the work of God, but will itself was the evil tree which bore evil fruit**. Evil will is not natural. Good things can exist without the evil, just as true and supreme God, in contrast evil things cannot exist without the good, since the natural entities in which evil exists are certainly good, in so far they are natural. The fact that Adam was not seduced doesn't mean he was free of guilt. He was actually prideful, he did not hide his sin, he did it voluntarily, thus evil will preceeds the original sin.

#### The Construction of St. Sophia: A Semi-Legendary Account

##### Paulus Silentiarius

> Keywords:  cleansing,

###### Justinian

> The direction of the north wing is a door that leads the people to the pure founts that cleanse human life and drive away the grievous scars of sin.

#### Deliverance from Error

##### Al-Ghazali

> Keywords: Apodeictic, Mutakallimün, Batinites, Philosophers, Sufis, Self-Evident Truth, Sense-Data, Skepticism, kelam, mystical states, fruitional experiences, fitra

He praises the prophet Mohammad who guided men from error, and declares that he'll be talking about his journey through various doctrines (Mutakallimun, Batinites, Philosophers, and Sufis) and how he ended up with Sufism. He points out that he wouldn't criticize doctrines without wanting to learn them first, also, talks about *fitra* which explains why people are Jewish, Christian, or Muslim just because they were aped slavishly by their parents of that religions. He contemplates about the meaning of **true knowledge**. For example, he says that if someone said "look! I turned this stick into a snake, therefore 2 is greater than 10." he wouldn't believe but wonder how he did it, since it is a self-evident truth that 10 is greater than 2, and sticks don't turn into snakes. First he thinks that other than sense-data and self-evident truths, he finds himself devoid of any knowledge. Then thinking of sense-data, he decides he should drop them also in respect of rationality, since stars look smaller but through geometrical proof we know they are not small. So, the **reason-judge refutes the sense-judge**. Then he points out that **reason-judge might as well be refuted by another kind of judge, just because we don't see it doesn't mean it is non-existent.** He gives the example of dreams in which one thinks they're experiencing the reality with sense and feeling but in fact we realize it is not true when the dream is over, so the waking life can also be a dream state for another life state. **This state is claimed by Sufis, calling it state beyond reason**. *Man are asleep: then after they die they awake.* This state beyond reason, since it is beyond reason, is impossible to be proven. Though he doesn't stop accepting the **self-evident data but he takes it with the light of God.** He lists the categories that seek the truth: *Mutakallimun, Batinites, Philosophers, and Sufis*. If truth evades this whole list of doctrines, then it is hopeless to ever attain it. He divides the philosophers into three groups: Materialists, Naturalists, and Theists. He passes on Materialists since they are Godless, and then Naturalists although they are fascinated by Nature thus by God, they denied the Last Day (the religion).  He is more into the Theists since they refuted the first and the second divisions, and Aristotle did it to the first Theists (Plato, Socrates) but, in the end, what Aristotle said was too complex and only muddled the minds of Islamic Philosophers. To sum up he says that the philosophy of Aristotle can be reduced to three parts: unbelief, innovation, and non-repudiated. He highlights that not all sciences are as lucid and apodeictic  as mathematics, and people should be aware of that. Then he both criticizes the philosophers and Muslims for denying the other's ideas just out of conformity, and without any reason behind it. Because neither philosophy nor religion refutes the other. Mutakallimun and Philosophers only differ in modes of expression. Then he moves on the Sufism. He describes their goal as **aiming to lop off the the obstacles present in the soul, to attain a heart empty of all save God** through **fruitional experiences and state of ecstasy** rather than study. He points out the difference of knowledge and experience that is **drunken man wouldn't know about his drunkenness and the man who knows about drunkenness wouldn't know how it is to be drunk**. In this fashion he elaborates how he decided on asceticism. **Sufis are masters of states, not purveyors of words**, he says to describe why he dropped out of his job as public and private instructor. Sufism is the way to have fruitional experiences that lead to knowledge. Favorable acceptance of it based on hearsay ad experience of others is "faith".

#### Hayy Ibn Yaqzan

##### Ibn Tufayl

> Keywords: Sufism, heart, bubble, fermentation, doe, trinity *of matter*, 

There two origin stories: first is that Hayy was created by matter. Organs: In which heart provided the sense of good and bad. Also, providing heat for other organs. Sensation of brain, nutrition of liver.

Hayy imitates the animals. He discovered in himself an aversion toward some things and an attraction to others for their *images were fixed in his mind. Naked and defenseless. 

## Themes 

### Light

**Lucretius** states in **On the Nature of Things** that people (grown-ups) fear the things in light just as the children fear the things in dark. Therefore this fear of mind must be shattered apart not by the rays of the sun (god) but by the external appearance and inner law of nature. 

**Augustine** in **City of God**, states that man regards himself as his own light (pride), and turns away from that light (God) which would make man himself a light (the original light - anal haqq) if he would set his heart on it. So, if man lives by the standards of God, he will be like God.

**Paulus Silentiarius** in **The Construction of St. Sophia**, describes how the archs are build in order to let the light in because they wanted the lights to represent the trinity: the father, the son, and the holy spirit.

**Al-Ghazali** states in **Deliverance from Error** that through realizing that there might an another state which is beyond reason, only argument for him to accept the self-evident data (*i.e., mathematics*) is through the light of God.

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, describes the light as the main source of warmth which is necessary of life through heart. Also, the represent beings by their aptitude to receive light, for instance, transparent beings are inanimate, opaques plants, shiny animals, and the reflective is human, also being completely reflective means that one is a prophet, completely reflecting the God's image, burning everything else.

**Christine de Pizan** in **The Book of the City of Ladies**, describes the light as a symbol of revelation of the divinity which is in this case the three ladies helping Christine in a time of despair.

**Dante** in **Inferno**,  describes dark places as places where God (light) in unreachable. The Dark Woods represent the hell in earth. In the first circle of hell (limbo) sun is mute because the people in limbo has no way of reaching God. 

### Trinity

**Paulus Silentiarius** in **The Construction of St. Sophia** (see light but it for also gates) 

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, three forms of mimesis: resembling inarticulate animal, celestial body, Necessarily Existent Being.

**Dante** in **Inferno** makes use of trinity in almost every aspect of the work. All the parts of the poem are in three lines, there are three beasts (describe) ...

### Reason

**Lucretius** in **On the Nature of Things** reasons about the first beginnings being in ever-lasting motion. Through reasoning he want to learn about laws of nature, first beginnings (atom). He leaves no place for religion. Because he thinks the reasoning is the ultimate proof of things.

**Virgil** in **Georgics**, describes bees without emotion, whereas he (virgil) is the symbol of reason against emotion.

**Augustine** in **City of God**, the obedience to God is held superior to the reasoning of Adam regarding eating the forbidden fruit. This reasoning is called **pride** by the author. (His own light)

**Al-Ghazali** states in **Deliverance from Error** that reason refutes the sense-data but it can be refuted by a state that is beyond the reason. He also makes the same connection with waking life and the next life, saying that also the next life can refute this waking life. (Man lives a dream, when he dies, he awakes (to the state beyond reason)). It is in order with **Inferno** because reason is not looked down upon but is not enough to reach God.

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, describes Hayy as a person through reason finds God. He reasons about the laws of nature first, and with the knowledge he gained he continues with same reasoning and connects to God.

**Christine de Pizan** in **The Book of the City of Ladies**, Reason is a divine character, who answers her questions regarding status of women in society with three: good intentions, envy, sexual frustration. Also Reason is the one who told Christine to build the city and was responsible for building the walls (the defense) herself (reason). 

**Dante** in **Inferno**, firstly, uses Virgil to represent reason whereas he is the one with emotion. This attitude probably sourced in his (Virgil's) works. Virgil tells Dante, when he pities the people who suffer in hell, that they're there because of justice (which is reasonable).

### Self

**Lucretius** in **On the Nature of Things** describes self as free-willed via the swerve occurring in the motion of first bodies, although they're predictable their swerve (though little from their course) causes them to at times unpredictable, thus makes free-will possible.

**Virgil** in **Georgics**, states that selflessness of the bees is one of the most important aspects of them. It is one of the things that enable them to be perfect. Keep in mind that Virgil basically defends, through the transformation from Republic to Empire, the importance of obedience.

**Ovid** in **Metamorphoses**, tells the story of Apollo and Daphne in which they're cursed by Cupid because of Apollo's pride. In the other story, Diana and Actaeon, Actaeon was cursed by Gods, through the request of Diana because he saw her naked, to transform into a beast. After the transformation his self stays intact though because his form is now of a beast, he loses speech and then is hunted by his fellow hunters and hounds.

**Augustine** in **City of God**, describes the original sin being through pride (being his own light) for both Adam and Devil. He basically argues that in order to live by the standards of God, one must follow the will of God, not the will of Men, thus being **obedient** and selfless. Also, there is the paradox of exaltation and abase. *There is something in humility to exalt the mind, and something in exaltation to abase it. Exaltation abases and humility exalts*.

**Al-Ghazali** in **Deliverance from Error**, on his journey all by himself because the way to God for him is one man journey. He does this in spite of others, he acts against social conformity and behaves the way he thinks is right. (disobedient, self-fulfillment through marriage with God).

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, he describes Hayy as consisting of two separate selves: the one resembling an inarticulate animal, the other resembling a celestial body. First is responsible for survival, second is for contemplation and thinking. These two are also the two of the three forms of mimesis. The last one is resemblance of Necessarily Existent Being. The goal is to be continuously aware of NEB, in order to be in ecstasy when death comes.

**Christine de Pizan** in **The Book of the City of Ladies**, reflects her own self in three different character/concepts (reason, rectitude, and justice).

**Dante** in **Inferno**, describes the people in the ninth circle of Hell as selfish, opposite of the bees' selflessness and loyalty in Georgics by Virgil. In the three mouths of Lucifer; Judas, Brutus, and Cassius are chewed endlessly. 

### Journey / Progress

**Augustine** in **City of God**, describes the progress from Paganism to Christianity.

**Al-Ghazali**'s **Deliverance from Error** is actually is his autobiography of his journey for true knowledge (God) resulted in God (truth). In this journey of thought, he first discovers the refutation of sense-data by reason-judge, then reason-judge by beyond-reason. The three of the doctrines (mutakallimun, philosophy, batinites) being not enough for truth, only way is Sufism.  The difference of experience and knowledge, action and study...

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, tells the story of Hayy's journey towards Necessary Existent (God). In this mental journey, he finds about his uniqueness comparing to animals, abstraction (object-permanence), his nakedness, the mortality (by the death of his mother Doe), and the causality (the causal relationship of internal organs to life), and finally then Necessarily Existent Being (and how to be one with it).

**Christine de Pizan** in **The Book of the City of Ladies**, describes his reasoning/journey through praise of women. First, Reason shows up and describes the type of people who criticize women and their motives (good intention, envy, and sexual frustration), gives the idea of building the city... City here is a metaphor for Christine's journey of realization? of women. 

**Dante** in **Inferno**, describes his alternate self passing through hell with the company of Virgil. In this journey, he first finds himself in dark woods (a metaphor for hell on Earth). He also has a strong and a limp leg. Former pointing out to his bound of Earthly material things (city of men), latter to the divine spiritual (city of God). Former is lower and the one which keeps him going, latter is higher and dragged along. He first goes to the Limbo (where virtuous non-Christians reside), then to the 2nd circle Lust (where people's biggest sin is in human emotions for love), then 9th circle Treachery (where people commit treachery in history are chewed by Satan endlessly). As a pilgrimage.

### Justice

**Augustine** in **City of God**, describes the punishment of Adam and Eve as a **reward for disobedience**. 

**Dante** in **Inferno**, ___

### Knowledge

**Lucretius** in **On the Nature of Things**, describes that nature can be understood better if it's taken as material, rather than the divine intervention and God's light etc. He doesn't talk any ultimate truth of sorts.

**Virgil** in **Georgics**, writes in didactic manner. The bees don't have the knowledge of what is good and bad. 

**Augustine** in **City of God**, describes truth as God. If men were to take himself as truth, he's following the path of Devil, since Devil did the same (followed the will of an angel). 

**Paulus Silentiarius** in **The Construction of St. Sophia**, deliberately misinforms the public regarding the construction. Instead of Justinian, he blames Justin for the collapse of dome.

**Al-Ghazali**'s **Deliverance from Error** the true knowledge which is el haq (God), is the point of his journey. He states that the true knowledge is in the state beyond reason which is capable of refuting reason-judge. Through Sufism.

**Ibn Tufayl** in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan**, lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

**Christine de Pizan** in **The Book of the City of Ladies**, suspects the knowledge's truth of preceding philosophers (Why women are bad? Are they really bad? What are the reason of these discourses?)  How can the women be bad if they were created from Adam who is good? Through reason, rectitude, and justice (characters) she created a ground for defense of women (city). 

**Dante** in **Inferno**, describes the people in Limbo as people who don't know God (true knowledge) therefore in Hell.

### Resignification

### Matter

**Ibn Tufayl** states in **Hayy Ibn Yaqzan** that matter the constituted Hayy consists of three bubbles: .., third bubble for protection of spirit. Transparent -> Inanimate, Opaque -> plants, Shiny -> animals, Reflective -> human. Reflective matter mirrors God (mirror reflecting on itself, burning everything else)



## Check these

- Praise of knowledge and ideas about the divinity (on the nature of things vs. inferno)
  - Okay to acknowledge the difference, then point out the similarities
  - Lucretius values divinity but gods are not the source of everything they don't intervene, also values science and better than religion, Dante differs in the fact that Christianity is more important (explain this chite)
  - Dante doesn't get into matter much
- Biggest sin in Inferno is treachery and in Georgics Bees are loyal, also human emotion is what is keeping us from perfection (Georgics) and the lust section is the first layer of hell (the ones who are in the first circle can be in heaven if not for lust)
- Ovid vs. Inferno: Interaction with God, in Ovid can directly meet with Gods, in Inferno one must be in heaven. Justice parameter is different in Dante, acting with the will of God that is good, on the other something else (Actaeon vs. Diana (who is stated to be harsh))? 

- Al-Ghazali vs Inferno: Dante is trying to materialize the things of what will happen in afterlife. Ghazali is just trying to think about what is right or what is not??
- Pizan vs. Inferno: Reason, knowledge,
