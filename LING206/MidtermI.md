# Language Typology

## 

## Linguistic Universals

They are also called "statements.” There are **absolute** and **non-absolute** universals.

> 1. All langugages have phonemic oral stops. *absolute*
> 2. Some languages ahave phonemic oral stops. *non-absolute*

### Absolute Universals

There are **restricted** and **unrestricted** absolute universals.

> 1. All language have oral stops. *unrestricted*
> 2. All languages that have more than 1 oral stop, have also [t]. *restricted*

### Existential Statements

They also can be **restricted** or **unrestricted**.

> 1. Some language have oral stops. *unrestricted*

---

> 1. All languages that have labial nasals also have alveolar nasals. *restricted, absolute*
> 2. If a language has labial nasals, it also has alveolar nasals. *restricted/implicational, absolute*

>**Existential**:
>
>1. Some languages have `Y` *unrestricted, non-absolute*
>
>**Universal**:
>
>1. All languages have `Y` *unrestricted, absolute*
>2. All languages with `X` have always `Y` *restricted/implicational, absolute*

### Unrestricted Universals

> 1. Some languages have `X`
>
> |         | `X`  |         |
> | ------- | ---- | ------- |
> | Type I  | +    | Turkish |
> | Type II | -    | English |
>
> 1. All languages have `X`
>
> |          | x    |             |
> | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
> | Type I   | +    | Turkish     |
> | *Type II | -    | English (*) |

#### Type A

#### Type B: *non-absolute* + *unrestricted*

> Some languages have nasal consonants.		(possibility) - True but NOT predictive
> Most languages have nasal consonants.		(probability) - True and somewhat predictive

### Relationship between the implicans & implicatum

#### Paradigmatic

> In all languages in which the inflected verb precedes the subject in yes/no questions, it does so in *wh*-questions as well.

#### Sytagmatic

> In all languages in which the inflected verb precedes the subject in wh-questions, the wh-word is normally initial.

#### Reflexive

**Implicaitonal Hierarchy**: Implicational hierarchies are statements byilt out of typological universals which are chained together. It is a typological generalization over sets of implicational universals, that is, as a deeper typological generalization than individual implcational universals.

**Monotonicity**:

**Agreement Hierarchy**:

**Animacy Hierarchy**:

**Controller Hierarchy**:

**Accessibility Hierarchy**:

#### Explanation Types

- In terms of relation among grammatical phenomena, *i.e.* only by lookingat the language system itself.
- Innateness and common genetic origins are not really good explanations for universality.
- External factors: language use, ease of processing, economy, iconicity, perception-cognition, …
  - They do not necessarily attempt to reduce every universal into one explanation. They use combination of explanations.
  - Keep in mind the tendencies that are universal for languages. For instance, *ease of processing* is the likely answer for the reason of centre-embedding in SOV languages.
