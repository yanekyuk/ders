#### Kew Gardens, Virginia Woolf

##### Plot

The story opens with the description of a flowerbed in a garden, detailing the colors and shaped of flowers. Throughout the story, we listen to pedestrians' conversation until they are abruptly leave the focus. First, a family walks through the scene in which we read a conversation between the husband and the wife, only to realize then it is actually the mind of the father. He contemplates on his past, then he contemplates on his conversation with his wife on his past. Then, narrative turns to a snail, snailing in the flowerbed, trying to get past the obstacles. Next, an older man and a young man comes into focus of whom the conversation is kind of irrational and mad. The focus of narrative then again changes to another set of people who are two lower middle-class women whose attention caught the eccentricity of the old man. Arguing over what the old man is saying, one of them gazes at the flowers and realize that it is tea time. We go back to the snail, who is about to get past "the high brown roof" of the leaf, two other figures approach and they seem to be in love. They stick an umbrella into the soil and wander off to have some tea. The narrative ends the scene with yet another description of the scene.

##### Theme

Critisizing the progress
Harmony in the order of things
Banality of everyday life

#### That Evening Sun, William Faulkner

##### In Class

Written in 1931 with Southern gothic style which is a very athmospheric and dark one. Its setting is American South (after civil war) which has always been associated with slavery. A very good example of Southern gotihc is _A Rose for emily_. Style's characteristics are being grotesque, violent, or just having potential of violence. A dominant aspect of gothic stories is nature as being a sinister power.

> American south got rich through slavery. After it was banned, the losing side (south) lost its economical power alongside gaining feeling of loss, dissatisfaction, and disillusionment. 

The story is clearly subjective, due to the narration being a memory of the protagonist, distorting the reality.

Modernism is Faulkner:

 - Interruption of linear temporality
 - Disjointed / fragmented flow of events
 - Jumps in the narrative
 - Non-filtered converstations happening in disturbing levels
 - focus on psychological realism
 - open ended, open to interpretation
 - double distance to reality about Nancy

##### Plot

Protagonists remembers 15 years ago, his childhood, in the town named Jefferson, especially the family servant Nancy, a black prostitute for white men who did his family's laundry. Nancy had a husband named Jesus who one day threatened to cut a white man's penis because he suspected that the white man was responsible for his wife's pregnancy. Protagonist, Quentin, then remembers a particular day when Nancy was too afraid to walk her home due to her fear of Jesus. Family escorts her to home everyday until the mother of the family complains about it. The day they stopped escorting her, Nancy began to be in horror, acting madly, detached from reality. The father, armed, checks for Jesus but can not find him anywhere. Around here, Nancy declares that **she is hell-born, doomed to death** to children. She wants to stay the night in children's room but the mother rejects, then she takes the children to her house thinking that their presence would protect her. There she tries to entertain them by telling stories and offering popcorn, but the children act restless and, Jason especially, want to go home. In the meantime, Nancy acts a bit strange, for instance she puts her hands on hot lamp, chimney and even fire without feeling pain. Then they hear voices of someone coming, but in the next chapter we find out that that someone is the father, upon arrival, tells Nancy to go stay somewhere else, takes the children and go away. While leaving Quentin asks his father "Who will do our washing now, Father?"

##### Theme

- Point of View:
  - PoV distorts reality. Author makes sure that we understand it.

- Racial Conflict: 
  - Prejudice against black people is filtered through children's perspective.
  - In the town where the story is set racism is very pervasive. It is mainly looked through children's point of view (plot-oriented), not the moral about it directly. Quentin remembers the events that is connected to racism, but he doesn't state his opinions on it.
- Madness:
- Memory:

#### Impressionism

An artistic movement emerged in France in 19th century.

> One doesn't paint a landscape or a figure, one paints an impression.
>
> Monet enough :D

_Le Chemin de Fer_,

_Un Bar aux Folies-BÃ©rgere_ depicts a bar distorted in the mirror. Definitely not realistic, it's experimental. Figure is centralized and very detached and looking directly to us, challenging our limits, boundaries. An impossible reality.

#### Post-Impressionism

_The Card Players (1890-95)_ depicts scenes in a way that is limited. There is no holisticity. The posture of the figures seem grotesque. They're bigger than one would expect. There is inconsistency in both space and figures. The space is not homogeneus. The reality is what we see rather the this objective truth existing out of our point of view.

_The Basket of apples (1895)_ requires two different perspectives. Experimentation of form, the unity of space, and the point of view (perspective) which can distort reality.

#### Muscle Memory, Karlin

##### In Class

**Setting**: The story takes place in post-Katrina New Orleans. New Orleans never mentioned, but it canbe deduced by the facts that the place is by the sea and it is in under risk of flood. The place is clearly an industrial setting, consisting of the French, the Mexican, and the American. Smells are used to portray the city as rotten, depopulated.

In the end, protagonist overcomes her past, just like in a fairytale. Industry is portrayed epicly.

Protagonist's journey of learning how to weld. 

##### Plot

##### Theme

  - Having no control is frightening.
  - Doppelganger? (Russian as best example)
- The house is more detailed (maybe more human) that the sister Madelein.

#### Detective Fiction

- It doesn't focus on psychology of characters in a Chekhovskian sense.
- It makes use of:
  - **Stock characterization** (naive character, dubious characters, etc.)
  - Sidekick / Narrator *i.e. Dr. Watson*

- First detective story was written by Poe.

#### A Scandal in Bohemia, Arthur Conan Doyle

- Written in 1891, just after Jack the Ripper murders. Jack killed sex workers, and the police couldn't catch him. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional solution to this disturbance of notbeing able to arrest a serial killer.
- Sherlock is an enigma, too eccentiric for reader to relate to.
  - He has an aristoctratic background.
  - He is open to irrationality, fantasy, magic
  - He is doing this for recreative purposes.
  - He is combining rationality with irrationality in a positive manner accompanied by a holistic view.
  - He depends on ratiocation and his methodology.
- Dr. Watson is a middle-class decent man just like the potential readers
  - He is like a pseudo-reader.
  - He is very goal oriented, rational, and determined.
  - He acts as a **foil** to Holmes.
  - He is the **volarization of the detective**.
- In Victorian era, serialization was very popular. People would go to work and in the train an easy-to-understand short story is a good read.
- In American Detective stories, the detective always carry a gun because what they are fighting are much more serious. In Sherlock Holmes, this isn't the case. 
  - Also American detectives are always lonely, just as lonely cowboys.
- The stories of Sherlock Holmes served as a soothing for the people. People was made to think that it was possible to solve the crimes through Holmes, reasoning, or trying harder.

#### Magical Realism

- All these stories are **antirealist**, have **post-modernist tendencies**, and is an example of **magical realism**.

- ```
  Ordinary + Extraordinary Life Details
  Rational + Irrational
  ```

- There is no hiearchy between magical and real. They are equal in the amount of attention given to them.

- The existence of fantasy elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism.

- Questioning and challenging reality and the absolute truths that are taken for granted.

- It can be thought as a political statement. Western reality doesn't represent other's reality. Instead, making fun of it appeals to people. Having to live with irrationality all the time causes this.

- Realism was a western movement, anti-realism emerged in South America.

- Childlike perspective is very usual in this style.

- [Metafiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction)

  - Author appears in the text

#### Light is Like Water, Gabriel Garcia Marquez

- Marquez is Columbian and writes in Spanish.
- The family in the story is Columbian and they are nostalgic. Buying a rowboat in Madrid doesn't make sense but for nostalgia.
- The things they are used to in Columbia don't appear in Madrid.

#### The Rememberer,  Aimee Bender

- Bender is American, writes in English.
- She keeps going to work, meanwhile extraordinary things are going on. This is an example of rational and irrational existing in the same time.

#### The Aquatic Uncle, Italo Calvino

- Calvino is and writes in Italian.

#### Science-Fiction

- Soft / Hard Sci-fi, former can be speculative. Latter usually not. ???
- Sci-fi was underrated in academia until recently. 
- Frankenstein is considered to be early science-fiction. (resurrection through science and technology)
- Science-fiction allows us to see our reality in a different perspective.
- **Novum** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for *new thing*) is a term used by sci-fi authors to describe the scientifically plausible innovations used by [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) narratives.
- In sci-fi the elements can be creative and/or threatening.
  - **Science / Technology**: Science is used as a reference point in a consistent way. Opposing to the magical realism where consistency is non-existant.
  - **Displacement**: Sci-fi has to exist in a different environment to ours. It can be our environment modified, or a completely another planet etc. It can be in space, in a diffrerent time, in a different social condition, or to an alien being. But it doesn't have to be all of it. **A familiar theme helps us to be immersed in the unfamiliar** which is realatable to magical realism as well.
  - **Estrangement**: Sci-fi moves the reader to a deep way of thinking about the text through alienation. Brecht used methods that are alienating the reader, enabling them to bu suspicious of the realities of the situations they face in life.
