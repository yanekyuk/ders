### Language Maintenance and Shift

- Bilingualism is always a necessary precursor of language shift.
- However, as a stable diglossic communities demonstrate, it does not always lead to language shift.
- Demographic factors, urbanness effect the language shift process. In urban context, there is less resistance to language shift.
  - Rural & Urban
  - The size of the minority group (*e.g.* Spanish in the US) is an important factor. If the minority is big enough they preserve their bilingualism.
  - If intermarriage is common, a shift is expected to the dominant home domain language.

#### Language Shift in Migrant Communities

> Fatma migrated to Germany with her family when she was 5. She spoke Turkish at home with her family. She began to work in a bicycle shop when she was 16. some of the other workers there also spoke Turkish. So she was peaking Turkish at home and at work. Only at school, she spoke German. She was good at her job, so she was promoted to be the store manager. She began to use more German although she still uses Turkish with her former workmates. Now she works at the headquarters of a car rental company and uses German all the time.

- This is a typical experience for those using a minority language in predominantly monolingual society.
- The language shift gradually takes place in different domains and the dominant language replaces the minority language.
- School is typically the first domain in which children of migrant families meet the dominant language.
- The dominant language infiltrates the home through children.
- There is pressure from the society to conform. Being good at the dominant language is a sign of successful assimilation.
- Abandoning the minority language altogether takes usually three or four generations but language shift is completed in just two generations.

#### Language Shift in Non-Migrant Communities

- Political economic and social changes can lead to language shift in multilingual societies.
- *e.g.* Iran is a multi-ethnic society and all minority languages are protected by constitution. However, Farsi the official language is a threat to other minority languages because they are not taught in schools and used in government offices.Even the governor of East Azerbaijan code-switches to Persian frequently when addressing an Azeri audience.

#### Migrant Majorities

- When colonial powers invade another countries, they impose their language along with their rule.
- In many cases, multilingualism as normal was well established such as in India, New Guinea, and many African countries.
- In cases where monolingualism is the norm, the colonizer's language has turned into a threat. In New Zealand, Maori people have moved from monolingualism in Maori in 19th century, through bilingualism in Maori and English, to monolingualism in English in the second half of the 20th century.

#### Language Loss and Death

- When all the Turkish migrants in the US shift to English in a few generations, that means the loss of Turkish for them. But it's not the death of Turkish.It will still be spoken in Turkey.
- When Tevfik Esenç dies in 1992, however the Caucasian language Ubykh died with him. He was the last speaker of that language.
- Dozens of Aboriginal languages spoken in Australia are dead now because their speakers were massacred by the Europeans and died by diseases they brought.

#### Language Revival

- *e.g.* Hebrew was almost extinct (it existed only in religious scripture). Once state of Israel was found, the brought people around the world, only common denominator being the religious language Hebrew was reconstructed.
- Welsh, though not as impressive as Hebrew, was replaced by English and then through some revivalist efforts with political supports it was revived to used in road signs, shop signs etc.

#### Factors Effecting Language Maintenance

- A language is maintained longer:
  - If there are attitudes and values attached to language. (e.g. Hebrew).
  - If the language is the symbol of group identity.
  - If the members of the community has frequent contact with each other.
  - If there is frequent contact with the homeland.
  - If the language is used in schools and in places of worship.
  - If there is institutional support.

### Language Variation

#### Dialectology

- Regional Variation -> regional dialects
- Usually a result of settlement history and physical geography *e.g. Sicilian, Gullah* 
- **Isogloss** is an imaginary boundary or line drawn on a map that separates particular linguistic features.
- **Isogloss bundle** represents a major dialect boundary.

#### Sociolinguistics

- Social variation -> social dialects
- Most societies are divided into groups with different **status**.
- This status used to be called "class" as in social classes of Marx.
- Some linguistic functions are **variable** (*i.e.* They can be expressed in two or more different **variants**.)
  - *i.e.* Tiki dialect can be described as `nasalization of vowels`, `higher pitch`, `longer vowels`, and `lowering of word-final vowels`
- One of the variants becomes associated with higher status groups and acquires **prestige**.

- Another variant becomes associated with lower status groups and acquires **stigma**.

```Labov&#39;s New York Study
Labov's NYC Study

Variable: rhotic /r/     i.e. /park/ vs. /pa:k/

Method: rapid anonymous survey in three department stores representing three social categories (Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Klein's)

Result: stratification of social class and prestige or standart forms. Also, lower and middle middle class tend to corrent themselves more tha any other.

Important notes:
	- hyper-correction was observable in LMC and MMC.
	- Mather (2012) repeated Labov's study with four department stores inNYC.
	- The results were essenitally the same.
	- In Labov's study, the older speakers pronounced /r/
	- But in Mathel's it was younger people who pronounced /r/.

Trudgill's Norwich Study

Variable: -ing, tune       i.e. /goɪŋ/ vs. /goɪn/, /tuːn/ vs. /tjʊn/
		  Pronounciation, Five Social Classes, Gender, and Formality

Method: He identified 5 social classes and contrasted gender and considered formality also. He gave wordlist to people to get them pronounce formally. He gave a short paragraph to people and then interviewed them. After, he had talked to them casually.

Result: 

In Gender Preferential Variation:

### Language & Gender

- When people self-report:
  - women over-reported their use of standard forms. That shows us that they prefer standard form for prestige. 
  - men under-reported their use of standard forms. The prestige of standard form is not that great for men. So, the non-standard form has **covert prestige** for men speakers.

- Explanations of women's linguistics behavior
  - Linguistic insecurity

  - Social status explanation

    Women use more standard forms that men because they are more status conscious. As standard speech forms are typically associated with higher social status, women use them as a way of claiming status.

  - Women's role as guardian's of society's values

    Society expects better behavior from women than men.

  - Subordinate groups must be polite

  - Vernacular forms express machismo (covert prestige)

- Innovative vs. Conservative

  - If innovation has a bad connotation, then women are innovative

  - If conservation has a bad connotation, then women are conservative

  - Women tend to use hyperbole

    ```
    Lakoff - 1974 | Language and Women's Place
    Describes women's language has typical features like they tend to 
     - use more hedging, 
     - use empty adjectives (awfully beautiful), 
     - use more precise color terms, 
     - use rising intonation in statements (uptalk, as if it is a question), 
     - speak more
    ```

    - **Dominance Approach**: Because men dominate women, women tend to speak as it is written up there. If a woman is not dominated in a situation, she doesn't speak in that fashion. Or, if a man is dominated in a situation, he tends to speak in that fashion.
    - **Difference Approach**: Men and women might speak differently. But that doesn't mean that one is better than the other. They learn to use language differently because of their backgrounds.
