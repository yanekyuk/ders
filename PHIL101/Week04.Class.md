## Meditation I
1. Which of my beliefs can be doubted?
    * foundationalism, knowledge, deduction, axioms
2. **Method of doubt**: Don't accept anything true if it's possible to doubt it.
3. ~
4. **Counterargument**: Only mad people doubt all their senses.
5. **Thought Experiment**: I can't be sure that I'm not dreaming right now.
6. **Counterargument**: Even if I was dreaming now, all the parts of it are coming from my experiences.

## Meditation II
1. Mind/Soul is more easily known that the body/material world.
2. **Example of wax**: Wax != Sum of its sensible properties. (_melted wax is still wax, a wax statue is still wax also_, implies **static essence** similar to Plato's **idea**) It appears **different**, but it is the **same**.
3. I perceive a piece of wax, therefore I exist as a mind. **Why?**
    > Because I think that I perceive a piece of wax. I think therefore I am.
4. **Descartes' Dualism**: No bridge between **material** and **idea**. **Matter** vs. **Mind** (_derivative substances_).

**Matter** | **Mind**
---        | ---
Exists in space & time | Not in space & time
Object | Subject
Indirect | Direct
**Uncertain** | **Certain**
Empiricist & Rationalist | Knowledge
- Although, he thinks that mind is the certain one.
- Subject is more certain **subjectively?**

## Notes
- Even Math is not certain, how can Philosophy be? Is it even possible to find ultimate truths via **rational thinking**?
- Empiricism, on the other hand, takes **interpretation** and **perception** as **inseperable**.
