# Week 3

## Epistemology

Appearance | Reality
--- | ---
Sun sets down | Earth revolves around the sun
We see starts now | As they were years ago
A table appears solid | It is mostly void
Sugar looks white | It is black when looked through microscope

- Is all reality knowable?
- Existing things **x** knowable things
- Nature, foundations, limits of knowledge?
- Propositional knowledge **x** Knowing how
- **Liar's Paradox** *I am a liar*
- Kant: We have to limit reason ~in order to find faith~

### Plato's Divided Line
**Epistemology** | **Ontology**
--- | ---
_Knowledge_ |
Pure Understanding | Intelligible forms (being)
(looking directly to the sun) |
Deductive Thinking | Mathematical Objects
(reflections out of the cave) |
_Opinion_ | 
Common beliefs (perception) | seeing puppets and fire
Uncritical impressions (imagination) | seeing shadows
Rationalist | Idealist

> How to save people by philosophy?
    
    - Plato thinks philosophers should rule.
    - Socrates thinks philosophers should argue with people.

### Escaping the cave
- Detachment from everyday life

**Appearance** | **Reality**
--- | ---
Material World (Becoming) | Ideas (Being)
Changing & Plural | Stable & Single
Exists in space & time | Exists beyond space & time
Imperfect | Perfect

## Sceptisism
1. About External World
    - Is there a knowable reality beyond our impressions?
2. About other minds
    - 

realtivity of human knowledge vs. dogmatism
middle ground is critical philosopy (kant)

> **Correspondance theory** vs. **Coherence theory**?

**Evaluate this argument.** (Deductive argument (valid, sound?))

P1. If external world did not exist, then I would not perceive it.
P2. I perceive the external world
Conclusion. Therefore external world exists.

> **Study logical fallacies following some premise conclusions.**

**Solipsism:** _I can only be sure of the contents of my mind, here and now. Everything else is my imagination._
