  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
  	p1["Are there universal moral principles != objective ethical value?"]--universal---e1["based on consensus of all people applicable to all/most societies. e.g. killing 'innocent' people is wrong"];
  	p1--"objective"---e2["true independent of what people believe"];
  ```

| Science (is) | Morality (ought) |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Descriptive  | Prescriptive     |
| Empirical    | Normative        |
| Facts        | Values           |
| Objective    | Subjective       |

- Moral **knowledge** is **impossible**.  
- Scienticism / Positivism



#### Ethical Subjectivism

```
	Right = What I approve	
	Wrong = What I disapprove
(no debate tastes, values)
	Stealing is wrong => I disapprove...
	Vanilla ice cream is best => I approve...
~ Nobody can be mistaken about his/her values. Violence is right for the sadist.
```

#### Cultural Relativism

```
Diversity Thesis: Different cultures have diff. moral principles. Therefore, there are no objective, universal principles. Why not valid?
			 \_ since common principles exists too.

#### Ethical Objectivism

If there are objective values, are they **discovered** (Plato, religions) or **invented** (Sartre)? Where to start? From **universal values**? Prohibition of murder; valuing truth-telling; caring for children.

- Combining **radical** social movements

  - feminism, anti-racism, environmentalism, conscientious objection

- Golden Rule? Suicide-bomber?

- Is everyone selfish?

  	a1["It is wrong for me to kill you."]-->b1["You don't prefer to be killed."];
  	a1-->b2["You prefer to be killed."]; b1-->immoral; b2-->moral;
