# An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding
## David Hume

- Distinguishing between **impressions** and **ideas**

| **IMPRESSIONS** | **IDEAS** |
| --- | --- |
|Sensory impressions    | Thoughts |
|Emotions               | Beliefs |
|Vivid mental phenomena | Memories |
| Clearly defined | Faint, obscure |
| Not likely to fall into error with respect | Easily confounded with other ideas |
| Innate | Wouldn't exist without impressions |

- Complex ideas are compounded out of simple ones.
- Human imagination is actually limited; a blind man is unable to imagine colors, a deaf man to imagine sounds, or a mild-mannered man to imagine cruelty.
- Distinguishing between **relations of ideas** and **matters of fact**

| **RELATIONS OF IDEAS** | **MATTERS OF FACT** |
|           ---          |       ---           |
| Mathematical truths    | Common truths       |
| Intuitively or demonstrably certain | Can only be (dis)proven with experience | 
| Denial would cause contradiction | Denial wouldn't cause contratiction |
| Rational justification | Cause & Effect |
| Reason                 | Habit |
| Demonstrative reasoning | Moral reasoning | 

- Hume turns these conclusions toward a compatibilist view of **free will** and **determinism**. If we perceive no necessary connection between events, we needn't worry that all our actions are causally predetermined. Rather than view free will as the freedom to have done otherwise, we should view it as **the freedom to act** according to one's own determinations, which is true of everyone but prisoners.
- Even a child knows from past experience that a flame will burn. If this knowledge comes from some form of reasoning, it must be a form of reasoning so obvious that even a child can grasp it. Why, then, Hume asks, is it so difficult to identify? He suggests that the child learns, not through reasoning, but through the conditioning of custom.
### Q & A
1. On what grouds does Hume claim that all knowledge is derived from sense perception? Why would you agree or disagree?
> Hume claims that **impressions** are **innate**, and that knowledge is a byproduct of impressions rendered by **three laws of associations** which are **resemblance**, **contiguity**, and **cause and effect**. I agree because even the skepticism of the reality of impressions relies on impressions themselves. Impressions are prior to the thoughts regarding them.
2. Provide an original example of a statement that shows a "Relation of Ideas" and one that is a "Matter of Fact".
> "Two plus two equals four." is an example of "Relation of Ideas" because it depends on other ideas and can be justified. "Tomorrow would last for 24 hours", on the other hand, relies on past experience and can not be justified, thus making it a "matter of fact".
3. Explain Hume's theory of causation. Could you refute his contention with an example of some cause and effect that you have seen?
> Soon...
4. Do you think there are other valid ways of knowing besides empiricism? What would they be?
> It depends on what we want to know and what knowing is. Soon...
5. How would you argue against the skeptic who claims we can never gain reliable knowledge?
> First things first, how would a skeptic be so sure about **never** being able to gain reliable knowledge? Is this sceptic not sceptical about their own thoughts' existence, or their reliability? I agree that we are not able to gain reliable knowledge, and when we do, it's usually justifiable with again our other justifiable thoughs until we reach a knowledge that is based on our impressions. In other words, if we are to regard our impressions non-justifiable, we don't even have a base reason to think that they're non-justifiable. It does neither prove or disprove *cogito, ergo sum*. I think that I think, therefore I do not necessarily think that I am or not.
