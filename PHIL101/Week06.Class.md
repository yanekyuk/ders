### Week 6
# Metaphysics / Ontology
#### What is the reality behind appearances?
- **Materialism**: Becoming (matter in motion) => science
    - Thales (water), Heraclitus (fire & logos), Democritus (atoms)
- **Idealism**: Being (unchanging spiritual reality) => metaphysics
    - Pythagoras (numbers), Parmenides (change is an illusion), Plato (ideas)
#### Epistemology: How can we know reality?
- Rationalism vs. empiricism

O/E | **Rationalist** | **Empiricist** | **Skeptic**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Materialist** | Spinoza | Locke | Hume
**Idealist** | Plato | Berkeley | Hume
**Dualist** | Descartes | 

- Empiricist assumption: All knowledge comes **from experience**.
    - Hume's challenge: Only **impressions** can be known, no **causal** link to **physical objects**.
    - Locke's answer: Primary _(mass, size, shape)_ vs. secondary _(color, taste, smell)_ qualities
    - Berkeley's rejection: 
        - Axiom 1: All reality is **mental** _(minds & their ideas such as sensations, feelings, thoughts)_
        - Axiom 2: Physical objects are only **families of sense-experience**.
        - Conclusion: We can never break free from our **impressions**. Objects can't exist without being perceived by **a mind**. **To be is to be perceived**. Object continue to exist, since perceived by God.
        - **Berkeley - God = Solipcism?**
- Two assumptions behind idealism:
    - Matter cannot think.
    - Mental experiences are necessarily private.

#### Materialism
1.  **Physicalism** (crude materialism) => mind = brain
    input/cause =>  | black box => | output
    --- |---|---
    broken leg | brain states | behavior _(shouting)_
2.  **Refined materialism**: Mind derives from matter.

    software | hardware
    --- |   ---
    mind | brain

3.  **Dual aspect theory**: Brain is seat of consciousness and conscious mental states have both physical and mental aspects.

    physical | mental
    --- | ---
    behaviors | actions
    have causes (neden) | have reasons (gerekçe)
    explanation | justification (meaning)
    determinist | free will

#### Matrix | Siddharta
- Personal Identity € Philosophy of Mild
- Our bodies, feelings, thoughts, values change in time.
- Is there something that remains the same? (the self)
    - **Yes**: Descartes (soul), Locke (self-consciousness & memory) - spatio-temporal continuity?
    - **No**: Hume, Indian Philosophy
- White's brain + Brown's body | Who is alive?
