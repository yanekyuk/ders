**critical thinking** | Making sure that we have good reasons for our beliefs.

**deductive argument** | an argument that is intended by the arguer to provide a guarantee of the truth of the conclusion provided that the argument's premises are true.

**inductive argument** | an argument that is intended by the arguer to be strong enough that, if the premises were to be true, then it would be unlikely that the conclusion is false.

**abductive argument** | an argument that is the arguer's best shot. You come home to find the door is open and TV set is missing. You guess it was stolen. But it may as well be that your roommate took it to repair and forgot the door open.

#### Who says what?

| Who? | What? | So? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Socrates | Know yourself | Men must stand and live according their nature through introspection. Because knowledge is within from the beginning. |
| Socrates or Plato | An unexamined life not worth living | For if we don't think, we are no more than animals, simply eating, sleeping, working and procreating. |
| Socrates | Death is not evil | Two possibilities after death exists: complete void like a deep sleep, or chance to meet dead people. Both are nice. |
| Russell | Philosophy diminishes our feeling of certainty as t owhat things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder, by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect. | This description of philosophy resembles the description of sciences. |

- Logical Fallacies 
  | Fallacy | Argument | Logic Behind |
  | --- | --- | --- |

  | **Argument from Ignorance** | "War is better because we haven't yet found a proof that peace is better." | X because not Y. Not Y, therefore X. |
  | **Straw Man Fallacy** |  As a counter-argument: "War is not better because more people die when there is a war going." | X is not because Z. |
  | **Ambiguity** | "War is better because, for example, war on drugs ceased the activities of drug cartels." | If X, then Y. Y(Z), therefore X. |
  | **False Dilemma** | "War is better because it's either war or famine." | X because there is X or Y. Therefore X. |
