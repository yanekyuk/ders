### Week 9
# Edwards - Internal Constraints on Freedom
- Common Sense says: "You should be more **realistical**!" But why? What if: Limits of the possible = Limits of the Permissible?
- Our experiences are shaped through social filters/cultural preconceptions => "propaganda model" - E. Fromm
- **Necessary Illusions**:
  1. Goal of society is economical progress
  2. Success (through social status) is the only way to happiness (indicators of success: more options to consume, having fun)
  3. We should believe that **freely chose** these goals
  4. Those who critisize this framework are **not realistical**

# Ethics
- "Everyone who has done something ***wrong** should be punished."
```
permissible: neither moral, nor immoral
moral action: praiseworthy
immoral: blameable
```

- universal moral value =! objective moral value
- universal moral value: accepted by all communities/societies/individuals (earth is flat)
- objective moral value: true, independent of people's beliefs (earth is round)
