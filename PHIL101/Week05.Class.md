## Week 5
# Hume
### How can we know / most trustworthy source of knowledge?
- Wikipedia or Google? Internet or books?
- (17th centruy) reason, senses, intuition OR authorities?
- Aristotle & Church: Why do objects fall? vs. Galileo: How?
- Reason vs. Sence = Math vs. Science = Certainty vs. Fallibility
- Teleology: herşey kendi doğasına uyun davranır.

### Hume
- He had **comprehensive skepticism** about religion, metaphysics, science, and morality.
- Sources of knowledge:
    1. Two types of mental experience: impressions (perceptions, emotions here and now) & ideas.
        - Three laws of association makes impressions into ideas.
        - Raw Material --processed my memory--> "my ideas" --imagination--> association of ideas
    
        | - | **Hume** | **Plato**
        | --- | --- | ---
        | 1) Material tree  | | is a faint copy of 3
        | 2) Idea of tree in my mind | is a copy of my impression of 1 | is a vivid copy of 3
        | 3) Idea of Tree | non-existent |
      
    2. Complex ideas -> additions of simple ideas -> impressions
        - God is infinitely **wise**, **powerful**, and **good**. (Infinite here is like the **virtuous**, as in virtuous horse, which renders the statement **meaningless**)
        - **Hume's fork**: relations of ideas vs. matters of fact

        | RoI | MoF |
        | --- | --- |
        | certain by definition, but trivial | empirical, uncertain, but not trivial |
        | it's denial is a logical contradiction | it's possible to deny without contradiction
        | analytical | synthetic prop. | 

        - **Principle of causality**: Every event has a cause. ****important****
        - **Principle of induction**: Future will be like past.
- What do we know about **causal relations**?
    - Event A causes event B?
        - Whenever A happens, B should happen.
        - Is it if B happened then A must have happened?
        - Empirical knowledges are inductive?
    - Causel relations are not in the world but based on subjective expectations.
    - **Hume**: If A causes B then we expect B to follow A. `P => Q != Q => P`
    - By habit, we have association of ideas. (faint copies of impressions)
    - I have an impression of an apple + I believe the apple exists != Apple exists
    - Principle of causation: Every event has a cause.
