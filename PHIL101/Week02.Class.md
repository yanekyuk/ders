### Fallacies of reasoning (Safsatalar)
1. Mere Assertion (stating your view) != Argument
    > **Argument:** War is better than peace because it eliminates the weak and destroys the enemy.
    > **Counterexample:** Strong and/or innocent people die in wars also.
2. Appeal to Authority
    > **Argument:** Economy is going well because newspapers say so.
    > **Counteraurgument:** Newspaper can be paid to say so. Every authority is dubious.
3. Ad Hominem (Against the Man)
    > **Argument:** He is a thief, so he probably lies too.
    > **Counterargument:** He can be a thief and a honest person. There is no correlation.
4. Circular Argument (Begging the Question)
    > **Argument:** God exist because bible says so, and the bible says the truth because it is the word of God.
    > **Counter:** Arguments verify each other. There is no verification besides them.
5. Argument of Ignorance (Burden of Proof)
    > **Argument:** You can not prove that God doesn't exist, therefore it exists.
    > **Counter:** Burden of proof lies with someone who is making the claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove.
6. Strawman
    > **Argument:** Socialism is wrong because everyone can not be equal.
    > **Counter:** Socialism is more than that. One weak argument does not make the whole idea false.
7. Linguistic ambiguity
    > **Argument:** Blind animals are rare, and rare animals are expensive. Therefore blind animal should be expensive.
    > **Counter:** There is an ambiguity in the meaning of "rare". Just because same word is used for situations doesn't mean they're the same thing. Reality is beyond language.
8. False Dilemma (black-or-white)
    > **Argument:** You either support the government or you're a terrorist.
    > **Counter:** There are other explanations besides black or white.
9. Slippery Slope
    > **Argument:** If we allow same-sex marriage, then the next thing we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys.
    > **Counter:** Saying that **Z** will eventually happen if **A** happens doesn't make sense. They're not necessarily connected to each other.
