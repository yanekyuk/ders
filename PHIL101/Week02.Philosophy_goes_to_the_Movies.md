# Philosophy goes to the Movies

## Summary
- **The Myth of the Cave** is imaginative vision Plato portrays the philosophically unenlightened as captives who are bound so as to see only shadowws berofe them on the wall of a cave, and who take these shadows for reality. Philosophical enlightenment, Plato argues, only comes when we escape from the cave and go out into the sunlight where we can see the real objects. The sense experience only gives us the shadows, in order to grasp the reality, we must break free from the senses and use reason alone.
- Very structure of the modern cinema is reminiscent of Plato's cave. However, there is another way of looking at what Plato's cave has to tell us. With this myth, Plato himself makes use of a vivid image to illuminate his own philosophical position, to convey a sense of what he wants to say.
- Movies can adress philosophical issues in a concrete way. As such they can also act as a corrective to philosophy, especially a philosophy that has lost itself in abstraction and universalization and has forgotten its connection to concrete existence.
- Philosophy is a 'second-order' discipline. It is a form of reflection in which we try to think about, clarify and critically evaluate the most basic terms within which we think and act.
- As philosophers, ordinarily we need to presuppose a good deal in order to get on with what we are doing. Scientists could not get on with doing science if they were constantly asking fundamental questions about what constitutes scientific knowledge; nor could we get on with our lives if we were constantly questioning our most basic beliefs. To stop and think about the underlying presuppositions of our activity would interfere with it.
- There are at least four ways in which films link up with philosophical themes.
  - First, films may have, as their subject of matter, specific philosophers and their work, for example _Rossellini_'s trilogy _Socrates (1970)_, _Blaise Pascal (1971)_, _Augustine of Hippo (1975)_, and _D. Jarman_'s _Wittgenstein (1993)_.
  - Second, films may be made of literary works that were philosophically inspired, for example _The Stranger (Gobbi & Visconti, 1967)_, _The Name of the Rose (J. Armand, 1986)_.
  - Third, films may be explicitly and self-consciously make use of or invoke philosophical ideas and positions, such as _Dark Star (J. Carpenter, 1972)_, _Love and Death (W. Allen, 1975)_ and many of the _Monthy Python_ films including of course _The Meaning of Life_.
  - Finally, films may present scenarios that, though not necessarily explicitly making use of philosophical issues. A typical example would be _Twelve Angry Man (S. Lumet, 1957)_.
