## Allophonic Relations

### Neutralizing rules and underlying representations

- Allophonic rules are not the only kind of phonological rule

- Allophonic  rules  determine  the  phonetic  properties  of  a  certain phoneme in a certain environment

- Other  rules neutralize  the  contrast  between  two  (or  more) phonemes – even if the two (or more) phonemes contrast in some environments, in other environments their contrast is not possible

- When neutralization  occurs,  the  two  (or  more)  phonemes  are phonetically  identical  in  the  neutralizing  environment  –  one  (or more phonemes) is (are) changed into another

  Environment 1: C_D C[A]D C[B]D
  Environment 2: C_E C[A]E *C[B]E

  - A consequence of neutralizing rules is that we don’t know which of the two (or more) phonemes is present, if the available words only show the phonemes in a neutralizing environment
  - They  can  be  recovered  only  examining  other  forms  of  the  same morphemes, in which the neutralizing environment is not present

  

- If a rule is neutralizing, by definition some word forms will be ambigous with respect to the nature of at least one of its phonemes, as the neutralizing environment is present in them.
- This may be true even of roots in isolation
- In Russian [urok] ‘lesson’ and [vrak] ‘enemy’ end with the same phone [k]. However, since Russian devoices word-final consonants,we cannot know if [k] realizes the same phoneme it both cases. Indeed, the genitive singular form of [urok] is [uroka], while the genitive singular form of [vrak] is [vraga]. Therefore /urok/ and /vrag/.
