### Interacting Processes

#### Separating the effects of different rules

Words may be subject to more than one rule. The different effects which these rules can have on a segment may accumulate, to give a seemingly complex pattern of phonetic change.

##### Palatalization and raising/fronting

![image-20191228231949147](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228231949147.png)

The group *a* shows that the nominative has no suffix, and the partitive has the suffix [-a] or [-æ].

The group *b* shows that roots which have /i/ as the underlying final vowel of the root.

The group *c* illustrates a phenomenon of final vowel raising and fronting, whereby *e* and *ə* become [i] word-finally.

![image-20191228232226160](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228232226160.png)

The group *d* shows that the vowel raising also causes palatalization in the root. *kurkə-a* appears as *kurt͡ʃi*. 

So, applying only vowel raising rule would result in sequence [ki] which is not allowed in this language. We come up with the palatalization rule.

![image-20191228232558198](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228232558198.png)

We can thus account for the change of underlying /kurkə/ and /əɫkə/ to /kurt͡ʃi/ and /əɫt͡ʃi/ by applying these two rules in a specific order, where the rule of vowel raising applies before palatalization, so that vowel raising is allowed to create occurences of the vowel [i], and those derived cases of [i] condition the application of palatalization.

Consider the fact that we make rules in their most simple forms until a further data says otherwise. 

##### Palatalization and Glide Formation

![image-20191228233103592](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228233103592.png)![image-20191228233113954](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228233113954.png)

The examples in (a) illustrate the causative affix following various non-velar consonants of the language. In (b), we see the causative of various roots wihch end in *k* or *g*, where by analogy to the data in (a) we predict the causatives /koβikjà/, /koβálokjà/, /kolɛ̋ɛ̀ŋgjà/, and so on. Instead of the expected consonant sequences *kj* and *gj*, we find instead the velar consonant has been replaced by an alveopalatal affricate, due to the following rule:

![image-20191228233514609](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228233514609.png)

Now, check these:

![image-20191228233859715](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228233859715.png)

In this set, you can see across all of the columns that the prefix for the infinitive is /ko/, and appears phonetically as such when it stands before another consonant. So, if the verb root was to begin with a vowel, we would predict to see examples such as **koasja* for 'to lose.’ But,

![image-20191228234112203](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228234112203.png)

![image-20191228234125839](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228234125839.png)

That is not the case. 

![image-20191228234647593](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228234647593.png)

But still, applying this rule doesn’t get us the output we want. For instance, *[kwűűna̋] and *[kwőőmba̋] are not the correct forms. Instead, we see that the glide [w] never appears before the tense round vowels [u, o].

![image-20191228235010953](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235010953.png)

So, glide formation first creates a glide, and some of the glides so created are then deleted by glide deletion.

![image-20191228235050866](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235050866.png)

##### Nasal+Consonant Combinations

###### Nasal Place Assimilation and Post-Nasal Voicing

![image-20191228235215050](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235215050.png)

In these examples, a voicing rule makes all underlyingly voiceless consonants voiced when preceded by a nasal, in this case after the prefix for the first-sinuglar present-tense suubject which /n/. The underlying consonant at the beginning of the root is revealed directly when the root is preceded by the third-plural prefix *βɑ-*, or when there is no prefix as in the imperative.

![image-20191228235459681](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235459681.png)

It’s also noticable that a nasal consonant always agrees in place of articulation with the following consonant.

![image-20191228235536344](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235536344.png)

So far, we haven’t really found what the underlying form of 1st person singular prefix is, since that nasal always assimilates to the following consonant. So, we look at roots that doesn’t have a consonant initially. We find out two facts this way:

![image-20191228235833071](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191228235833071.png)

In the imperative, when there is no consonant initialls, [j] is inserted always. And what’s more is these verbs in 1st person-singular prefix, appear to have *n-* initially. This time, the order of the rules doesn’t matter:

![image-20191229000025227](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000025227.png)

---

###### Post-Nasal Hardening

![image-20191229000219028](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000219028.png)

Another process of consonant hardening turns voiced continuants into stops after a nasal: *l* and *r* become *d, β* becomes *b*, and *j* becomes *d͡ʒ*.

![image-20191229000233903](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000233903.png)

This rule and previous post-nasal voicing rule can be combined now:

![image-20191229000505240](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000505240.png)

###### *l*-deletion

A third process affecting sequences of nasal plus consonant can been in the following data:

![image-20191229000702970](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000702970.png)

![image-20191229000713842](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000713842.png)

The examples before (b) show the effect of rules of voicing and consonant hardening, applying as expected to /t/ and /r/. However, the examples in (b) show the deletion of underlying /l/ after nasal. These examples contrast with the first set of examples, where the root also begins with underlying /l/: the difference between the two sets of verbs is that in the second set, where /l/ deletes, the following consonant is a nasal, whereas in the first set where /l/ does not delete, the next consonant is not a nasal.

![image-20191229000950285](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229000950285.png)

This rule clearly must apply before the hardening rule changes /l/ into [d] after a nasal, since otherwise there would be no way to restict this rule to applying only to underlying /l/.

###### Nasal Cluster Simplification

![image-20191229001113981](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229001113981.png)![image-20191229001122879](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229001122879.png)

Another phonological process applies to consonants after nasal consonants. When the root begins with a nasal consonant, the expected sequence of nasal consonants sipmlifies to a single consonant.

###### Nasal Deletion

![image-20191229021122529](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229021122529.png)

The final process which applies to sequences of nasal plus consonant is one deleting a nasal before a voiceless fricative. The underlying form of *fuma* 'I spread’ is /n-fuma/ since the prefix for 1sg is /n-/ and the root is /fuma/, andthis contains a sequence nasal plus voiceless fricative. Our data indicate that this sequence does not occur anywhere in the language, so we may presume that such sequences are eliminated by a rule of nasal deletion. The formulation accounts for deletion:

![image-20191229021358217](/home/yanekyuksel/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191229021358217.png)

So, we’ve came up with 2 rules: Nasal Deletion, Post-Nasal Voicing-Hardening. Since *f* does not become a voiced stop and instead it is the nasal who gets processed, Nasal Deletion rule must come first.

###### Summary

This is the order of the rules that we’ve found:
