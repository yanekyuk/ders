# LING 201 - Phonology

## What is Phonology?

> <small>SUMMARY</small>
> Phonetics and phonology both study language sound. Phonology examines language sounds as mental units, encapsulated symbolically for example as [æ] or [g], and focuses on how these units function in grammars. Phonetics examines how symbolic sound is manifested as a continuous physical phenomenon. The conversion from the continuous external domain to mental representation requires focusing on theinformation that is important, which is possible because not all physical properties of speech sounds are cognitively important. One of the goals of phonology is then to discover exactly what these cognitively iimportant properties are, and how they function in expressing regularities about languages.

**Sound**: It is a complex pattern of rapid variations in air pressure. There are two approachs to studying sound: *Acoustics* and *articulation*. Former approach is the study of the properties of the physical sound wave that we hear, latter is the study of how speakers to modify the shape of the vocal tract to produce a certain acousic output.

**Accuracy**:

*Phonetics* deals with “actual” physical sounds as they are manifested in human speech. ***Phonology***, on the other hand, is an abstract cognitive system dealing with rules in a mental grammar: principles of subconscious “thought” as they relate to language sound. As research in both of these fields has progressed, it has become apparent that a better understanding of many issues in phonology requires that you bring phonetics into consideration, just as a phonological analysis is a prerequisite for phonetic study of language.

### Concerns of Phonology

Phonology is concerned with “sounds” that are **symbolic sounds**; maning they are cognitive abstractions which represent the physical sounds.

Another aspect of language sound which a phonological analysis would take account of is that in any given langugage, ceration combinations of sounds are allowed, but other combinations are systematically impossible. For instance, *brick*, *bribe*, *break* are all English words that begin with a consonant sequence *br*, meaning that English has no restrictions against it whatsoever. So, whenever a word begins with the sequence of *br* and doesn’t commit to any other restrictive sequences, they would be a good canditate as a possible word. A native English speaker would know that *brue* is not a real word, but a quite possible word in English. As the opposite, they would also know that *bnick*, *bnark*, and *bniddle* cannot be possible English words.

A phonological analysis would also explain the variations or general patterns in pronounciation.For example, there is a very general rule of English phonology which dictates that the plural suffix on nouns will be pronounced [əz], repesentend in spelling <es>, when the preceding consonant is one of a certain set of consonants including [ʃ] as in *bushes*, [ʧ] as in *churches*, and [ʤ] as in *cages*. This pattern of pronounciation is not limited to the plural, so despite to the same rules of pronounciation, the possessive suffix *s* is also subject to the same rules of pronounciation: thus, plural *bushes* is pronounced the same as possessive *bush’s*.

### Phonetics – what is physical sound?

The tools of phonetic analysis can provide very detailed and precise information about the amplitude, frequency and time characteristics of an utterance–a typical spectrogram of a single-syllable word in English could contain around 100,000 bits of information. The problem is that this is too much information–a lot of information needs to be discarded to get at something more general and useful.

In order to have an understanding regarding the sounds, we need to first decide on how are we goint to represent them, and in order to represent them, first we need to consider what a *sound* is. Two basic aspects of speech sounds will help us answer this question.

#### Acoustics

From the acoustic perspective, “sound” refers to mechanical pressure waves and the sensations arising when such a pressure wave strikes your ear, which in turn cause a series of neural signals in the brain.

#### Articulation

Another way to analyze speech sounds is in terms of the arrangements of articulators – the lips, tongue and other organs of the vocal tract required to produce a particular speech sound. Using these articulators to manipulate the airflow produces the speech sounds.

### Phonology – the symbolic perspectiveon sound

Physical sound is too variable and contains too much information to allow us to make meaningful and general statements about the grammar of language sound. We require a way to represent just the essentials of language sounds, as mental objects which grammars can manipulate. A phonological representation of an utterance reduces this great mass of phonetic information to a cognitive minimum, namely a sequence of discrete segments.

#### Symbolic representation of segments

The basic tool for converting the continuous stream of sound into discrete units is the phonetic transcription. The idea of reducing an information-rich structure such as an acoustic waveform to a small repertoire of discrete symbols is based on a very important assumption, one which has provento have immeasurable utility in phonological research, namely that there are systematic limits on possible speech sounds in human language.

*Vowels*: The three most important properties for defining vowels are **height**, **backness**, and **roundness**. In height parameter, three primary values are generally recognized, namely **high**, **mid**, and **low** and it’s augmented with the secondary distinction **tense / lax** for *non-low* vowels. Tense vowels are higher and articulated further from the center of the vocal tract compared to their lax counterparts. Independent of height, vowels can differ in relative **frontness** of the tongue. Three phonetic degrees of horizontal tongue positioning are generally recognized: **front**, **central**, and **back**. Finally, any vowel can be pronounced with protrusion of the lips, which characterizes any vowel as **rounded** or **unrounded**.

Table is **NONROUND TENSE**, NONROUND LAX, **ROUND TENSE**, ROUND LAX

*Consonants*: Where the IPA term for consonants like [p b] is “plosive,” these are referred to phonologically as “stops.” Lateral and rhotic consonants are termed “liquids,” and non-lateral “approximants” are referred to as “glides.” Terminology referring to the symbols for implosives, ejectives, diacritics, and suprasegmentals is generally the same in phonological and phonetic usage. In addition to these, plain stops and affricates are grouped together.

## Phonetic Transcriptions

> <small>SUMMARY</small>
> Because phonology views speech sounds symbolically, knowledge of the system of symbols for representing speech is a prequisite to doing a phonological analysis. It is also vital to know the phonetic parameters for describing the sounds of human languages which have been presented here. The main characteristics of vowels involve fronting of the tongue (*front, cental*, and *back*), *rounding*, and vowel height (*high, mid*, and *low*, with *tense* and *lax* variants of high and mid vowels). Other properties of vowels include stress, tone (including *downstep* and *upstep*) and the phonation types creaky and breathy voice. Primary consonantal places of articulation include *bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, alveopalatal, retroflex, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal* and *laryngeal*. These may be supplemented by vowel-like secondary articulations including palatalization, velarization, pharyngealization, and rounding. Consonants may be produces with a number of constriction and release types, and may be stops, fricatives or nasals, and stop consonants may be unreleased or released, the latter type allowing plain versus affricate release. Differences in the laryngeal component for consonants include voicing and aspiration, and the distinction between ejectives and implosives. Vowels and consonants may also exploit differences in nasalization and length.

## Allophonic Relations

> <small>SUMMARY</small>
> Contrasive aspects of pronounciation cannot be predicted by rule, but *allophonic* details can be. Allophonic changes are a type of rule-governed phonological behaviour, and phonology is concerned with the study of rules. The practical concern of this chapter is understanding the method for discovering those rules. The linguist looks for regularities in the distribution of one sound versus others, and attempts to reduce multiple surface segments to one basic segment, a *phoneme*, where the related segments derive by applying a rule to the underlying phoneme in some context. Going beyong static distribution of sounds, you should look for cases where the pronounciation of morphemes changes, depending on the presence or absence of prefixes and suffixes.
>
> Assuing that sounds are in complemetary distribution, you need to determine which variant is the “basic” underlying one, and which derives by rule. The decision is made by comparing the consequences of alternative hypotheses. Sometimes, selecting underlying `/X/` results in a very simple rule for deriving the surface variant `[Y]`, whereas selecting underlying `/Y/` results in very complex rules for deriving `[X]` from `/Y/`: in such a case, the choise of `/X/` over `/Y/` is well motivated. Sometimes, no definitive decision can be made.

## Underlying Representations

> Establishing the correct underlying representation for a morpheme is the most important first step in giving a phonological analysis of data. A correct underlying representation unifies surface variants of a morpheme, giving recognition of the basic “sameness” of a morpheme, regardless of variations in pronounciation which arise because phonological rules have applied. The underlying form and the system of rules are thus connected: by making the right choice of underlying form, and given the right system of rules, the rules will correctly operate on just those segments which participate in the alternation. The key to making the right decision about underlying forms is to carefully consider different hypotheses: if a segment in a morpheme has two or more surface realisations, it is often necessary to consider two or more possibilities for what is underlying – is variant [a], [b], or [c] the right choice? The main issue relevant to answering this question is knowing which variant preserves important distinctions and which neutralizes distinctions. The underlying form may not be a form inferred from considering a number of specific instantiations of the morpheme.

## Feature Theory

> Language sounds can be defined in terms of a small set of universal phonetically based features, which not only define the basic atoms of phonological representations, but also play a central role in the formal expression of rules. An important theme of this chapter is the nature of scientific theorises, such as the theory of features, which make predictions both about what can happen and what cannot appen. The fundamental role of feature theory is to make specific predicitons about the kinds of segements and rules that we should find in human languages. One of the main concerns of phonological theory is fiding the correct set of features that define the sounds and rule systems of all human languages.

**Observation**:

**Predictions**:

**Features**:

**Natural Classes**:

### Major Class Features

**syllabic (syl)**:  forms a syllable peak (and thus can be stressed)
**sonorant (son)**: sounds produced with a vocal tract configuration in which spontaneous voicing is possible
**consonantal (cons)**: sounds produced with a major obstruction in the oral cavity

### Place of Articulation

**high**: the body of the tongue is raised from the neutral position
**low**: the body of the tongue is lowered from the neutral position
**back**: the body of the tongue is retracted from the neutral position
**round**: the lips are protruded
**tense**: sounds requiring deliberate, accurate, maximally distinct gestures that involve considerable muscular effort
**advanced tongue root**: produced by drawing the root of the tongue forward

**coronal**: produced with the blade or the tip of the tongue raised from the neutral position
**anterior**: produced with a major constriction located at or in front of the alveolar ridge
**strident**: produced with greater noisiness
**distributed**: produced with a constriction that extends for a considearble distance along the direction of the airflow
