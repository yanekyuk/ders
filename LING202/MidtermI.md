### Basic concepts, Language Types

***Syntax vs. Morphology***: Syntax has categories like *Verb*,*Tense*, *Negation*, etc. whereas  morphology has categories like *root*, *affix*, *clitic*, etc.

Write down the syntactic and morphologica l categories of the **boldfaced** items

|                  | Syntactic | Morphological                              |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ***believe***    | verb      | root / stem                                |
| ***belief***     | noun      | root / stem                                |
| ***understand*** | verb      | compound                                   |
| ***hardly***     | adverb    | root + suffix (stem, polymorphic, complex) |
| *coward**ly***   | adverb    | suffix                                     |

- Morphology is the study of the **internal structure of words** (the study of the combinations of morphemes to yield words.)

- Morphology is the study of the **relation between words** (the systematic co-variation inthe for ma nd meaning of words,) e.g. *played, jumped, housed, munched* all share a phonological segment (*-ed*) and a corresponding semantics (past), so they varu together as a group of verbs in the past tense containing *-ed*.

- The term of morphology is used in different ways:

  (i) 'Morphology’ as the **structure of words** or as **co-variations between words** (as above)
  (ii) 'Morphology’ as the **branch of linguistics** (e.g. as opposed to syntax)
  (iii) 'Morphology’ as the …

#### History of Morphology

**Sumerian conjugation tables from 1600 BCE**: Sumerian is a language isolate (does not genetically belong to the family of the surrounding languages) of Mesopotamia. It was overtaken by Akkadian but to be able to  understand the literary language, the the literature recorded Sumerian conjugations iin clay tablets. (*baduu* he goes away, *baduun* I go away)

**Sanskrit conjugation lists, 5<sup>th</sup> Century BC**

**The beginnings of comparative philology**: Mostly British scholars (clerks of the British East India Company but also scholars in other European countries) 'discovered’ Panini’s work and started studying it. By comparing these to European languages, they discovered that Sanskrit was related … … …

**Amercan Structuralists**: They also wroked mostly on word structure of native American languages in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

**1957, Chomsky Syntactic Structures, and after**: In the 1950s, linguists started viewing grammar as something more that words and their internal structure. So studies in syntax flourished. Not only languages with impoverished morphology but those with complex morphological design were syntactically studied. So ***the view from syntax*** took over, meaning words were subjected to the same principles of phrase structure. This gave way to a split. One group thinks morphology is an extension of syntax into words, the other group thinks morphology has its own principles which cannot be reduced t otsyntactic principles.

#### Morphological Diversity

**Isolating**: no affixation (chinese, vietnamese). But they do have compounding.

**Analytic**: identifiable affixation in some words (English). Also have compounding.

**Synthetic**: simultaneous realization of meaningful units (Latin, Russian).

**Agglutinative**: multiple affixation of functional categories to a stem (Turkish, Japanses, Chamorro)

**Polysynthetic**: In addition to functional categories, words can contain more that one lexical category. (West Greenlandic, Mohawk)

**Templatic**: New words are formed via infixation and apophony (Semitic Languages)”

| Roots                                                      | Affixes                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No fixed position inside the word form.                    | Usually fixed position inside the word form.                 |
| Cna occur alone as a word form. (May be *free* or *bound*) | Cannot occur alone as a wırd form. (*bound*)                 |
| Have a specific meaning.                                   | Have abstract meanings that may depend on the other morphemes in a word form |

Challenges to the root affix distinction: (F&S p.9) *ismo* as a free form(!). Neoclassical units *logue*, *philo*, *drrone*.

##### Conditions on roots and stems

**Roots** bear the core meaning of a word and are non-segmentable into smaller parts. That may ve free or bound .

The word **stem** is used in more than one sense: (i) a dictionary word that is larger than a root but nevertheless has its individual meaning. (ii) an item which differs according to the affixes it combines with, (*e.g.* Persian *mund* (say: used with past tenses), *mum* (say: used with present tense)) These are **bound stems** and are also called **bound roots**.

| Gloss | INF     | Past    | Progressive | Type                  |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| *die* | mord-æn | mord-æm | mi-mir-æm   | **base modification** |
| *see* | did-æn  | did-æm  | mi-bin-æm   | **suppletion**        |

**Turkish suppletion**: *ol-*, *var*, *yok*. *var* and *yok* turns to *ol-* and *olma-*

**Base**: Any item to which an affix may ve added. These can be a root, a stem, a phrase, a quotation/saying, a sentence…

| Gerunds / gerundives | Derived Nominals |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| refus-ing            | refus-al         |
| criticiz-ing         | critic-ism       |
| amus-ing             | amuse-ment       |
| grow-ing             | grow-th          |

Certain words can be formed in syntax, but many not. Those who can not be formed in syntax are called lexicals. There are tests such as attaching an adjective;

> John’s **sarcastically** critisizing of everything.
> John is a master of **sarcastic** criticism.

Models representing morphological operations:

- After remarks of nominalization: **Morphology-by-itself** = seperate component for word structure
  - **Morpheme-based** theories 
    - Item & Arrangement
  - **Word-based** theories
    - Items & process (IP)
    - Later: Word to paradigm forms
- Later: **Morphology-as-part-of-syntax**:

##### Item & Process (IP)

IP was came up with when IA models could not deal with conversion and base modification. They can also apply to concatination.

|        | process                 |          |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------- |
| *look* | apply **past tense** to | *looked* |
| *sing* | apply **past tense** to | *sang*   |
