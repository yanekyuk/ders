**DESCRIPTION**



The course introduces the basic concepts of word formation and the tools that are employed in the analysis of words. The topics are word formation strategies, morphological structure, patterns, and operations, paradigms, the lexicon and productivity, and the connection of morphology to the other components of grammar (phonology, semantics and syntax). We will investigate these topics in the languages of the world including sign languages. We will also discuss and evaluate various current approaches to morphology and the lexicon during the course. Students are asked to do the readings before class, as the exercises that will be done during class hours will draw upon these readings. This is essential for active participation. 



**COURSE MATERIAL**



We will be using sections from the following two books:



Haspelmath, Martin & Andrea. D. Sims 2010. [second edition] *Understanding Morphology*. London: Hodder Education. 

 Abbreviated in the schedule as **H&S**.

Fábregas, Antonio & Sergio Scalise 2012. *Morphology; From Data to Theories*. Edinburgh University Press. 

Abbreviated in the schedule as **F&S**.



**REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT**



(i)	Regular attendance (no overlap with other courses accepted) 

(ii)	Two assignments (10% each) (To be discussed in PSs)
