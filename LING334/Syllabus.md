**Description**

This is an introductory course to the development of human language. Within 3 to 4 years, if they don’t have any developmental issues, children, no matter where they are born, acquire a language and sometimes more than one language, as their native language. We will examine how the human language is acquired by children within this very short time window by examining the development of different modules of the grammar. The course also includes chapters on the acquisition of more than one language, language acquisition under special conditions and to the extent time allows discussion of literacy development.
