1. Describe and contrast the different methods available for functional brain imaging. What do they all do? What are the differences among the available methods?

   > **EEG / ERP** measures electrical activity in the brain via electrodes placed on the scalp. This is one of the most easily conducted brain imaging technique. It detects electrical activities in the brain in real-time, but it is unable to give much information because it only detects the surface areas of the brain.
   >
   > **MEG** directly measures magnetic activity in the brain via a helmet (a big one). Since earth has its own magnetic field, the patient and the machine has to be inside an very expensive room which is *magnetically shielded room (**MSR**)*. Since it directly measures the activity it is able to get the timings right, and since it makes use of magnetic fields it is able to get the location of the activity right.
   >
   > **fMRI**, like MEG, measures magnetic activity, but unlike MEG, its able to do so via tracking the blood flow, thus can be called an indirect approach. Since it makes use of blood flow and the blood flow itself has some lagging (because it travels in and out of brain), the patient has to lie down in the device without any movement, and even so the timings of the activities are not good enough as it is in MEG and ERP. Although, it has a pretty good spatial resolution. P.S. Too expensive.
   >
   > **NIRS** measures the transmission of light through the brain tissue. Ligth and ligth sensors are placed on specific parts of the head and the measurements are collected by the light transmittability. Since it is light, it has an excellent temporal resolution (although the book never mentions this), but its spatial resolution is not as good as fMRI or MEG because it gets it data via collection of linears. Since these lines have depth (all through the other end of the head) it is still better than ERP. This technology is not as expensive as MEG or fMRI.

   **Question**	Reading the textbook and making a quick research by myself, it occured to me that MEG is superior to fMRI regarding brain research. I couldn’t stop wondering then why the textbook didn’t focus on it as it did on fMRI. Am I right to think so?

2. Outline the evidence that language is a left-hemisphere function in adults.

   > There are a lot of evidence regarding the left-hemisphere function for language. For instance, Paul Broca, when he had the autopsy of his patient who was only able to say *Tan*, he found out that in the patient’s brain’s left-hemisphere there was a lesion. Another example would be the patients whose corpus callosum (a part of brain that is responsible for the communication between the hemispheres) is removed (called split-brains). When these patients were shown objects only in their left-half of vision (left half of each retina communicates with right hemisphere) they were not able to speak the name of the object. These patients were able to draw the objects presented in the pictures with their left-hand though. 
   > But actually, I did a quick research on these experiments and learned that when the experimentees were shown "words” instead of objects in their left visual field, most of them were still able to draw the object referenced by the word using their left-hands. So, I guess right-hemisphere has some capabilities regarding language recognition (or written text representation of languages) but not the production of it.

3. Children recover from aphasia more quickly and more completely than adults do. Why?

   > That’s related to the plasticity of their brain. Although right hemisphere is better at processing language naturally, a healthy person would just strengten the neural pathways accordingly to this natural inclination. Meaning that, during their first years of language development, right hemisphere is being trained to process this development, in the end, resulting in a productive system that rooted in the right part of the brain. But if the right part of the brain is unavailable during the language development, then left hemisphere is included in the process of the development. Thus resulting in a language development in the left brain that no adult can achieve after they already did the same in right-hemisphere during the initial language development (because left hemisphere is already developed not the process the language that much).

4. What is neural plasticity, and what causes its decline?

   > Neural plasticity is the brain’s ability to create specific areas for specific functions. When these specific areas for their specific functions are used over and over, the ties between the neurons are strenghtened in a way to make these functions easier for the brain to process. In the end, the brain would end up in some kind of tendency to “take the road more travelled by” and thus rendering itself unable to deconstruct the pathways and “make any difference” if required.
