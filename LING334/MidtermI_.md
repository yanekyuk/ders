## Introduction to the Study of Language Development

#### Summary

Language development is a multidisciplinary field that has as its central question, how is language acquired? Because  language is highly complex  yet universally acquired, the answer to this question has profound implications for understanding the essential nature of the human mind. Because language is a vehicle for social interaction and acquired in a social context, the answer to this question may also reveal how development is supported and shaped by the social environment. The study of language development also has practical importance for education, for the treatment of communicative disorders, and for second language instruction.

Acquiring a language includes learning the sounds and sound patterns of the language (phonological development), learning the vocabulary of the language (lexical development), learning the structure of the language (grammatical, or morphosyntactic, development), and learning how to use language to communicate (pragmatic and sociolinguistic development). The study of language development has a long history because questions about how children’s language emerges have long been considered central to larger philosophical and scientific debates. These debates have concerned the intrinsic nature of humankind and the role of experience in shaping human nature. The modern study of language development began in the 1960s following the Chomskyan revolution in linguistics. Chomsky argued that the study of language is the study of the mind. In turn, the study of language development captured the interest of researchers interested in the study of the developing mind. Language development is a field divided along several fault lines. Some major points of disagreement are 

1. whether language is largely innate in the child or learned from experience; 
2. whether the knowledge that underlies children’s language ability is highly abstract or more like a memorized repertoire of constructions that serve communicative goals; 
3. whether the mechanism that underlies language acquisition is specific to language or consists of general purpose cognitive abilities applied to the task of learning language; and
4. whether the communicative functions that language serves (for children and adults) account for language acquisition, contribute to the process of acquisition, or are merely a benefit of language acquisition that must itself be explained in other terms. 

Child language researchers also debate whether the most useful approach to understanding language development is to focus on children and ask how they acquire language (the developmental approach) or to focus on language and ask how it is acquired by children (the learnability approach). Language development researchers use a variety of research methods and designs. Central to a great deal of research is the collection of speech samples from children for the purpose of characterizing the children’s productive language. Collecting speech samples involves recording children as they talk and transcribing and coding the recorded speech. Computer programs help in that process. For some purposes, researchers may not need to collect new speech samples if their question can be addressed by examining the speech samples contained in the CHILDES archive. For descriptive and assessment purposes, a variety of norm referenced tests and measures of language development are available. Because language development is a multidisciplinary field, articles and chapters on language development appear in widely diverse sources. Most of these are indexed in one of two computer-accessible databases: PsycINFO or Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts

##### Current Study of Language Development

###### Biological Approach

The human capacity for language is best understood as a biological phenomenon, and language development is best understood as a biological process. It looks for:

- Universal features of language development
- A hereditary basis to language ability
- Evidence of a biologically based timetable for development
- The processes in the brain
- The nature of the child’s innate linguistics knowledge
- LAD must contain some knowledge of the structure of language in order for language acquisiton to be possible
- Findings cannot be specific to any particular language, thus UG

###### Social Approach

Focuses *(i)* on the social aspects of interaction as the experience relevant to language acquisiton and *(ii)* on the social cognitive abilities of the child as the relevant learning capacities.

###### Domain-general Approach

States that language acquisition is a product of problem-solving mechanism of mind and children solve it the same way that they solve any other problems.

- Developmental systems approach: Early developments and/or genetically based characteristics in one domain provide the foundation for subsequent developments in other domains.
- Dynamic systems theory: Language emerges as a result of the <u>continuous interaction of the components of the system and the environment</u>. Language abilities over developmental time and the moment-to-moment processes that occur as the child assembles words and longer utterances. <u>Transitory states</u>?

#### Review

1. Describe the role the study of language development plays in cognitive science and applied fields.

   > Cognitive science aims to understand how human mind works. Language, as a part of human mind, is an incredibly complex function of the mind which is acquired easily during childhood. How a language is acquired can be a leading answer to human mind and behavior. So, studies on language acquisition plays a large role on the debate over the characteristics of human cognition.
   >
   > In applied fields, however, the immediate answers of the language development research are utilized in cases where a child having problem with language acquisition. In those cases, some practical findings regarding language development and acquisition can play a big role in the prevention and the treatment of language-based difficulties.

2. Learning a language involves learning in several separable domains. List and define the components of language knowledge.

   > **Pragmatics**: the transmittal of information to others in socially appropriate ways. Being able to make requests, to comment, to be coherent in conversation and narrative.
   >
   > - ~9m: Baby communicates with intention.
   > - ~1.5y: Baby’s communicative purposes are more distinguishable.
   > - ~2.5y: Child takes initiative in a conversation and acts responsively.
   > - ~3.5y: Child’s narrative skills develop.
   >
   > **Phonology**: the sounds and sound systems of a language. A baby, when born, is able to differentiate all the possible human speech sounds, but in time, s/he develops to a point to mark the ones that are relevant (phonemic) in the target language.
   >
   > - ~3m: Baby starts vocal play.
   > - ~9m: Baby starts canonical babbling.
   > - ~1.5y: Baby reorganizes and consolidates the phonological representations.
   > - ~2.5-3y: Child completes the phonetic inventory of target language.
   > - ~3.5y: Phonological awareness grows.
   >
   > **Lexicon**: The words and the associated meanings. Knowing the meaning of words and how to form new words. 
   >
   > - ~3m: A baby recognizes their own name.
   > - ~1y: They use their first word.
   > - ~1.5y: They have around 50-word vocabulary (word spurt)
   > - ~2.5y: Around 500-word vocabulary.
   > - ~4y: Knowledge of derivational morphology increases vocabulary.
   >
   > **Morphology / Syntax**: The systems that govern inflectional morphology and word combination. Knowing the difference in meaning between *Man bites dog* and *Dog bites man*.
   >
   > - ~1.5y: Baby uses their first word combinations.
   > - ~2-3y: Baby’s word combinations increase in length, they start adding grammatical morphemes, and forms negative and question forms.
   > - ~3.5y: Child starts complex (multiclause) utterances.
3. What questions can be addressed by studying children who grow up without exposure to language?

   > There are two types of children who grew up without exposure to language. First is that children who grew up without a language input but there was a social exposure. For instance, the deaf children of hearing adults tend to make up gestures and combine them to generate new meanings by themselves, suggesting that combining symbols together to communicate is natural in humans. Second is that children who grew as social isolates. For instance, *Victor*, a boy who was found to be living in wild until 12 years old, upon being discovered, never managed to learn how to speak. This phenomena is against the idea of language being completely and solely innate in humans. As it turns out, a social interaction is required for language development (critical period).

4. What was the Chomskyan revolution, and how did it affect the study of language development?

   > The Chomskyan revolution was the radical change of studying of language after the publication of *Syntactic Structures* in 1957 by Noam Chomsky. Before the revolution, linguists used to study the regularities in languages. But Chomsky pointed out that the underlying grammar is far more interesting that the surface one. This raised a new question regarding language development, that is, if adults have mental grammar that is producing their surface grammers, then what is the underlying grammar of children?

5. Define and contrast nativism and empiricism as (a) explanations of the origin of knowledge and (b) as approaches to explaining language development.

   > *(a)* Empiricism is an experience-based knowledge approach, stating that knowledge is built from ground up by experience alone. Whereas nativism states that experience alone is not enough and some preexisting structure is required for knowledge.
   > *(b)* The nativist view of language suggests that humans have an innate knowledge of properties of language. Whereas the empirical view behaviorism suggests that language is acquired by repeating and seeking approval. The behaviorist view has not stood the test of time or empirical evidence. There is another empiricist view called interactionist view, but this is not completely empiricist because it utilizes the innate properties too.

6. What makes interactionism a nativist approach?

   > Because interactionist does not argue that there are no innate characteristics of mind. They argue that language acquisition results from the interaction of innate characteristics of the child’s mind and the child’s language experience. Meaning that innateness first, experience second (but definitely required).

7. Why do generativists and usage-based theorists agree that there can be no compromise on the question of whether humans have innate linguistic knowledge?

   > Because in either case, there is a universal linguistic structure underlying the language acquisition because every person has the same general cognitive processes which enables them to acquire the language.

8. What can be learned from studying language development in other cultures and other language groups that cannot be learned from studying the acquisition of one language in one culture?

   >First of all, discovering other language’s way of processing is crucial to understanding what is universal or not. Without the research on other cultures and languages, one would presume that whatever is seen in language development in English is universal like a mother talking to her baby is crucial for language acquisition but there are cultures that do not participate in this while nevertheless the baby acquires the language just fine.

9. Imagine you had to explain to your skeptical family (or roommate, or somebody) why you are taking a whole course just on language development. How would you justify spending this much time on such a narrow topic?

   > Because

## Biological Bases of Language Development

This chapter considered language development as  abiological phenomenon. The reasons for characterizing language development as a feature of human biology and some of what we know about the biological bases of language development include the following:

1. Language is a universal characteristic of the human species. Not only do all human societies have language, but in situations where there is no target language to learn, humans in interaction will spontaneously create language.
2. The capacity for language is served by physical structures (in the vocal tract and in the brain) that seem, to a certain extent at least, to be specifically dedicated to their linguistic functions. In most mature adults, language functions are carried out primarily by the left cerebral hemisphere.
3. The brain appears to be biased from birth to rep-resent language in the left hemisphere. In child-hood, however, the mapping of language function to brain location is different and more diffuse than it is in adults.
4. The development of new techniques for imaging children’s brains has led to the development of anew field, developmental cognitive neuroscience,and the study of the neural underpinnings of language development is central topic in this field.
5. Although many myths are associated with the critical period hypothesis, there is clear evidence that language acquisition is more successful when it is begun early than when it is begun late, and age of exposure has effects even within childhood. The age boundaries for the sensitive period for language acquisition may differ for different components of language. There are probably multiple bases for the observed age-of-acquisition effects, including the declining plasticity of the brain, effects of early tuning of speech perception, and age-related differences in learning opportunities and motivation.
6. Individual differences in language skill among typically developing children are, to a degree, genetically based, and language impairment has a strong genetic component. One gene that plays a role in language development, FOXP2, has been identified, but it is clear that multiple genetically based capacities contribute to language.
7. The human capacity for language is species specific. The results of research on the naturally occurring communication systems of other animals and the results of experiments that have attempted to teach a human language to another primate suggest that language is uniquely human. Most interesting, the comparisons of the human’s capacity for language to the ape’s capacity for language begin to provide a basis for hypotheses about the nature and evolution of the uniquely human characteristics that account for language.

## Class Notes

#### Language and Other Species

- Define language and then ask whether the communication systems of other species meet that definition

  - Human language: *reference (symbol use to refer), syntax*, and *intentionality*

  - Communication among primates:

    - The East African vervet monkey, that has these alarm calls: *leopards, eagles, snakes*. What criteria is satisfied? What is missing?

    - Chimpanzees have calls, facial expressions, and gestures. 

    - Also, there is concept of continuity (because primates has the properties of human language in different competence, for instance they only refer to physical entities whereas humans can refer to mental entities too):

      > Spoken language [is] merely an extension and enhancement of cognitive capacities to be found among our ape relatives. (Leakey & Lewin ,1992, p.240)

    - Thee bees dance stating direction, distance, and richness of source

    - The male baby birds learn from exposure to male adult birds how to attract mates, maintain territories via singing. Also, there is babbling (subsong), importance of deafening after vs. before acquisition, critical period of language acquisition, social interaction and left hemisphere lateralization.

##### The Acquisition of Human Language by Other Species

- Efforts to teach chimpanzees to speak

  - Failure. But not fair comparison with humans. Chimpanzees have a vocal tract that makes speech production essentially impossible. But the question is “do Chimpanzees have the brain for language?”, not “whether they can say words.”

- Efforts to teach sign language

  - Signing apes:
    - *Washoe,* a 4 years old female chimp. Learned to produce 132 signs. … The sign combinations Washoe produces were always preceded by
    - *Koko*, a gorilla. Patterson claimed that Koko not only understand "everything that you say to her” but she also communicates via her sign language skills "about the way animals view the word.” **Careful analysis revealed that what Koko could do was limited.** All of Koko’s signs were signed first by the teacher.
    - *Nim Chimpsky*, a chimpanzee who has learned more than 100 signs. The length and nature of the multi-sign utterances. His MLU was between 1.1 and 1.6 signs which is way less that a human child’s. Long sentences were repetitions. His longest sentence is: GIVE ORANGE ME GIVE ORANGE GIVE ORNAGE ME GIVE ORANGE etc.
    - They only used particular contexts such as food.

- Artificial Language Projects

  - Lana

  - Very limited learning

    > sadasda

- Language in a Bonobo

  - A different species of chimpanzee (closer to humans). Upright posture, eye-contact, gesture, and vocalization in communication more frequently than common chimps.

  - *Matata and Kanzi*: While teachers were teaching Matata, Kanzi –who was a baby– learned much more. Yet, still not symbolic, more instrument-like. Strawberry: outside the testing context, all Kanzi’s sees of strawberry resulted in his getting to eat strawberries. 

    > “Give Sue the bubbles”, "Put the rubber band on the soap”, "Go to the oven and the the tomato”

- Why can’t chimpanzees acquire language? They are highly intelligent. Why don’t bonobos in the wild have a communication system that makes use of a semantically based grammar? **Chimpanzees may be limited in language by their limited production abilities.**

- Chimps are incapable of either learning a human language or creating their own because they are incapable of understanding that things have names.

- Another pro: Chimpanzees lack culture. No socially transmitted behavior. The chimpanzee’s ability to learn through interaction with others –that is, for the social transmission of behavior– is extremely limited. Chimpanzees do not figure put things.

  - The lack of the social/cognitive ability to learn through interaction with others.
  - To attribute mental states to others: a theory of mind

##### The Origin of

#### Review

1. How is the universality of language evidence for a biological basis to language? How is it not?

   > Wherever there are humans there are language. It’s almost as if human cannot help having language.

2. What does it mean to claim that the human vocal tract is specialized for language, and what evidence supports that claim?

   > It means that the human vocal tract, throughout its evolution, prioritized language the most in its all functionalities. It is evolved in such a way that it enabled human species to be able to produce various sounds with ease and at the same time disabled them not to be able to produce these sounds while eating via the danger of choking to death. This means that being able to speak was more advantageous than not being subject to danger of choking to death.

3. Describe and contrast the different methods available for functional brain imaging. What do they all do? What are the differences among the available methods?

   > **EEG / ERP** measures electrical activity in the brain via electrodes placed on the scalp. This is one of the most easily conducted brain imaging technique. It detects electrical activities in the brain in real-time, but it is unable to give much information because it only detects the surface areas of the brain.
   >
   > **MEG** directly measures magnetic activity in the brain via a helmet (a big one). Since earth has its own magnetic field, the patient and the machine has to be inside an very expensive room which is *magnetically shielded room (**MSR**)*. Since it directly measures the activity it is able to get the timings right, and since it makes use of magnetic fields it is able to get the location of the activity right.
   >
   > **fMRI**, like MEG, measures magnetic activity, but unlike MEG, its able to do so via tracking the blood flow, thus can be called an indirect approach. Since it makes use of blood flow and the blood flow itself has some lag, the patient has lie in the device without any movement, and even so the timings of the activities are not good enough as it is in MEG and ERP. Although, it has a pretty good spatial resolution. P.S. Too expensive.
   >
   > **NIRS** measures the transmission of light through the brain tissue. Light and light sensors are placed on specific parts of the head and the measurements are collected by the light transmittability. Since it is light, it has an excellent temporal resolution (although the book never mentions this), but its spatial resolution is not as good as fMRI or MEG because it gets it data via collection of linear. Since these lines have depth (all through the other end of the head) it is still better than ERP. This technology is not as expensive as MEG or fMRI.
   
4. Outline the evidence that language is a left-hemisphere function in adults.

   > There are a lot of evidence regarding the left-hemisphere function for language. For instance, Paul Broca, when he had the autopsy of his patient who was only able to say *Tan*, he found out that in the patient’s brain’s left-hemisphere there was a lesion. Another example would be the patients whose corpus callosum (a part of brain that is responsible for the communication between the hemispheres) is removed (called split-brains). When these patients were shown pictures only in their left-half of vision (left half of each retina communicates with right hemisphere) they were not able to speak the name of the object presented (or possibly write it with their right hand) in the picture. These patients were able to draw the objects presented in the pictures with their left-hand though. 

5. What is the role of the right hemisphere in normal language functioning?

   > As evidenced by language impairments associated with right-hemisphere damage, the patients with the damaged brain sometimes produce abnormal intonation contour when they speak, and hey may have difficulty recognizing the emotional tone of an utterance. They also have difficulty understanding jokes and sarcasm, along with interpreting figurative language, and following indirect requests. These difficulties suggest that right-hemisphere may be involved in the pragmatic aspects of language use. Some ERP scans also show that the right hemisphere is activated by semantic processing.

6. What is the evidence that the left hemisphere is specialized for language in children?

   > Young infants show greater activation in the left hemisphere when presented with a variety of acoustics signals, not only speech. With newborns, it found that speech elicits greater left-hemisphere activation than does the same speech signal played in reverse (which removes the speech-like quality of the sound). Another evidence is that, in children who had learned to speak already, left-hemisphere damage is more likely to result in aphasia, whereas in children who did not acquire the language yet it less likely to result in aphasia. 

7. Children recover from aphasia more quickly and more completely than adults do. Why?

   > That’s related to the plasticity of their brain. Although right hemisphere is better at processing language naturally, a healthy person would just strengthen the neural pathways accordingly to this natural inclination. Meaning that, during their first years of language development, right hemisphere is being trained to process this development, in the end, resulting in a productive system that rooted in the right part of the brain. But if the right part of the brain is unavailable during the language development, then left hemisphere is included in the process of the development. Thus resulting in a language development in the left brain that no adult can achieve after they already did the same in right-hemisphere during the initial language development (because left hemisphere is already developed not the process the language that much).

8. What is neural plasticity, and what causes its decline?

   > Neural plasticity is the brain’s ability to create specific areas for specific functions. When these specific areas for their specific functions are used over and over, the ties between the neurons are strengthened in a way to make these functions easier for the brain to process. In the end, the brain would end up in some kind of tendency to “take the road more travelled by” and thus rendering itself unable to deconstruct the pathways and “make any difference” if required. 

9. What is meant by the critical period hypothesis, and what is the evidence regarding this hypothesis?

   > It is the notion that a biologically determined period exists during which language acquisition must occur, if it is to occur at all. Evidence for it comes from "Wild” Children who grew up as isolates from society and without the knowledge of language. When these children were found, it was found out that it was too late for them to acquire language

10. What kind of evidence would support the notion that human language is genetically based? What do the data suggest?

    > An evidence for language similarity in twins would support the notion that language is genetically based. The data should suggest that all the components of language should bear high rate of resemblances in between the twins, such as their usage of syntax and vocabulary.

11. What questions can be addressed by the study of animal communication systems and by the study of attempts to teach a human language to another primate? What answers does the evidence suggest?

    > The study of animal communication systems can address the question whether human language is unique or these systems can be described as "languages.” An attempt to teach human language to another primate would address the question whether the language is a faculty that is solely unique to humans. The answers to these question vary depending on how one describes “language.” Nevertheless, the language acquiring capacity of other species had been found to be very limited. No other species can utilize language to the extent of how an adult human utilizes.

12. Explain and contrast the several proposed accounts of the evolution of language.

    > **Language as an Evolved Capacity**: This idea depends on the notion that the species evolve the way the evolve because the modification serve a useful purpose. So, language faculty came to be because it was useful to have it.
    >
    > **Language as a Module and an Adaptation**: According to this view, language is a complex, special-purpose mechanism. Just like an eye is evolved for vision, and the heart for pumping blood. This notion suggests that the mind is like a swiss army knife with many different special purpose tools rather than generally useful single tool.
    >
    > **Language as the modification of other cognitive capacities**: According to this view, if we concern ourselves with idea  that evolution barres some huge mutation, it has to work with the material that is already there. So, language is more likely to be a modification on other cognitive capacities that came to be in small parts.
    >
    > **Language as Emergent from Other Cognitive and Social Capacities**: 
    >
    > **Language as a by-product of evolution: The alternative view claims that the capacity for language is not the result of evolution but rather is a by-product of other evolutionary changes. The capacities that underlie language were selected for other purposes and then recruited for language—much the way our nose has other reasons for its shape, even though it is useful for supporting eye-glasses. Similarly, there may have been a variety of selection pressures that operated to increase the size and power of the brain (a generally better brain being a generally useful thing to have). Then, having gotten so much larger in the service of general improvement in its old functions, the brain was also able to perform new functions. 

## Foundations of Language Development in Domain General Skills and Communicative Experience

Language acquisition results whenever human children experience language used in communicative interaction. Although it is not possible to state with certainty whether or not children have innate linguistic knowledge, it is clear that children come into the world with many nonlinguistic skills that support language acquisition and that children’s experiences make a substantial contribution as well. There are two types of evidence for the importance of these foundational skills and experiences to language acquisition. One is evidence that infants have skills and experiences that could be useful for language learning. The other is evidence that differences among children in their skills and experiences are associated with differences in the rate at which they develop language.

The foundational skills and capacities children possess include social cognitive abilities and understandings. Infants are interested in other persons, they understand other persons to be intentional beings (unlike inanimate objects), and they have a desire to communicate with these other beings. By the end of their first year, infants engage with others and communicate with others and these prelinguistic interactions set the stage for the conversations that will provide children with the raw data for figuring out their language. In that task of figuring out the sounds, words, and structural properties of their language, children are served by perceptual skills and domain-general learn-ing abilities. From birth, children can hear and discriminate the different sounds that spoken language makes use of. Children come to the language acquisition task with prior conceptual understandings of the meanings the language encodes. Infants have prodigious abilities to learn the patterns in the sounds they hear and even to learn abstractions from the patterns in the particular sounds they hear. Individual differences in these early skills predict individual differences in the subsequent rate of language development.

The speech children hear is a rich database for language learning. There are patterns in the distribution of acoustic signals, in the co-occurrences of syllables and words, in the relation between prosody and structure, and in the correlation between meaning and structure that provide language learners with clues to cracking the linguistic code. The special properties of infant-directed speech exaggerate some of these clues, making it easier for children to find phonetic categories in the acoustic signal, to find words and larger grammatical structures in the speech stream, and to map sound to meaning than analyses of adult-directed speech would suggest.

The strongest evidence that children use the speech they hear as their database for language learning is in findings that the richness of the database children are exposed to is related to the rate at which they acquire language. A rich database for language learning children consists of contingent conversational interaction with a speaker who illustrates a rich vocabulary and a variety of grammatical structures. There are wide differences among adults in the amount they talk to their children and in the degree to which their speech has the properties that support children’s language development. Some of these differences in how language is used in talking to children are related to socio-economic status, and these SES-related differences in talking to children explain a great deal of the reliably observed SES-related differences in young children’s language skills.

### Class Notes

- Interaction is the key to language learning.
- Children from different socio-economic, or the ones who get more interaction in thesame socio-economic status have larger vocabularies.
- **Joint Attention**: A child playing with her mom, talking about the teddy bear while looking at the teddy bear.
- **Intention Reading**: Children understanding intentionality in actions. 
- **Environment**: 
- **CDS**: Cultures that make use of CDS, put the child in an advantaged position.

#### Social Cognitive Skills of Infants

- **Joint Attention**: pointing, following the points of others, following the eye gaze of others, between 10 and 11th months infants first show gaze-following (they turn to look whereantoher person is looking), after 12th month infants point and look at a potential communicative partners.

  - Infants who are faster at developing joint attention skills are also more advanced in later measures of language development

- **Intention reading**: Understanding that other people have intentions (particularyl)
  We humans tend to give away what we are thinking about by where we are looking, and infants use this information.
  When children hear someone produce a novel word, they will take it …

  - 2-year-olds will infer that a novel label produced with an expression of surprise refers to an object that is novel to the speaker.

  Children learn language in the absence of joint attention. But it is in a slower pace.

#### Communicative Use of Gesture

- Pointing first, but later children use iconic communicative getures before they use words. Commonly, reaching gesture, opening, closing (to indicate *give*)
- Children’s communicataive use of gestures predicts the language development that follows.
- Gesture is predictive in grammar development too:
  - Pointing to couch and mommy predics that noun + noun combination will occur in child’s speech

- Mothers elaborate on children’s gestural communications

#### Sensory and Perceptual Foundations of Language Development

- Children come to world with abitility to hear language around them, inclination to attend to it over other sounds, ability to match speech sounds with faces athat produce them, and ability to hear sound conrasts (then, they become tuned to a part)
- Babies get bored hearing the same sound. So, this is used in experiments a lot. For instance, sucking rate increases when babies are excited.
- Children are trained when there is a novel word and there is a visual stimuli also. So, when they hear a novel word they turn their heads.
- Hearing children start hearing in the womb. They get more excited when they hear their mother’s voice. When the mother reads a story when she is pregnant, when the baby is born, he/she pays more attention the story that was read when she/he was in their mother’s womb.
- Babies pay attention to sounds that are novel. For instance, a baby in an enviroment where there is distinction between [b] and [p], would pay attention to the VOT of the sounds. Probably to ~20 VOT [b] and ~50 VOT [p]. Other mammals can do theses too.
- Children are universal listeners until 6-8 months. By time, they tune to a specific collection of phonetics. For instance, the sound [l] is perceivable for both American and Japanese babies during their 6-8 months but while American babies get more successful at perceiving the sound during 10-12 months, Japanese babies are less able to.
- Growth of one’s vocabulary is in line with one’s phonological inventory. ?? (Vocabulary growth as function of phonetic discrimination abilities in infancy) !!CHECK THIS OUT!!

#### Cognitive Foundations of Language Development

- A child must also have some cognitive foundations to be able to recognize language.
- An experiment: Thereis a screen, firsy a cup shows up behind a screen and comes back, then a book shows up. It is expected to find behind the screen both of them. But only 10 month-olds are not surprised when the book is missing.
- It is foundational to understand categorizing, relational concepts, and properties of objects.
- Not only object, the children have cognitive capacity to understand events. What is moving or not, or where. When there is a complex event, a child is able to distiguish parts of the events seperately (path, manner, motion of action). Children would categorize the path of the event and can break it down and match the event to another events.
- Sometimes a linguistic form is going to emerge before th econcept. Sometimes a children is goint to make use of a linguistic form only then to understand the concept behind it.
- Piaget thought that language is a manifestation of child’s symbolic function. It arises from child’s sensorimotor interactions with the environment.
- Symbolic play; symbols that represents object that are not there. Holding a banana and pretend that it is a telephone.
- Statistical learning: *bidakupadotigolabubidakugolabubidakupadotitupiro*
  - A child can understand the patterns in this continious blabbering of made-up words and can distinguish the words: *bidaku*, *padoti*, *golabu*, and *tupiro* !!CHECK THIS!!
  - It is not bound to language learning. We, humans, always make use of statictical learning.

## Phonological Development: Learning the Sounds of Language

### Class Notes

- This course of prespeech vocal development appears to be universal, and even the particular sounds babies produce are similar across environments. However, beginning as early as 6 months, the sounds that babies produce are somewhat influenced by the languagethat they hear. This phenomenon is known as **babbling drift** (R. Brown, 1958a).
- There are acoustic differences between availble 200 sounds in human languages. Like tones, aspiration, and phonemic. A child needs to distinct these features to acquire target language.
- Words consist of phonemes but there is more structure to it. For instance, syllables do have thier own structure such as onset or rime (nucleus nad code), or combination of them.
- Phonotactics: Apart from which sounds are availble in a language, there is also the question of how to combine them. For instance, the words *kpakali* nad *zloty* are not possible in English.
- Children are aware of phonological rules such as voicing *(bugs, bikes, bugs)*. *Wug test*.
  - They know the assimilation rules too. *Spaghetti* becomes *pa**zg**hetti*
- For obvious reasons, in order to represent sounds, we use IPA. A transcription can be broad or narrow.
  - A broad transcription would limit itself with phonemic representations of sounds.
  - A narrow one would make use of phones and their diacritics such as aspiration etc.
- Basic distinction between vowels and consontants is the degree of obstruction (constriction).
  - Consonants can be distinct by their place of articulation, manner of articulatio, and voicing (VOT).
- Speec sounds have these features: sound sequences, stress, prosody (the ways of chunking speech 3sounds into speech).

- Before speech, children make all kinds of sounds. *Reflexive Crying and vegetation sounds*, then *cooing and laughter*, then *reduplicated babbling*, and before the first word, finally *nonreduplicated babbling*.

  - Vegetative sounds: sounds that accompany biological functions such as breathing, sucking, etc.
  - Cooing and laughter: Coos are sounds that babies make when they appear to be happy and content. Quality of cooing changes over time.
  - Vocal Play:  Expansion stage, consonant-like and vowel-like sounds that infants produce increases.
    - Marginal Babbling:  The long series of sounds by the end of this stage.
    - Also squeals, growls, and a variety of "friction noises.”
  - (6-9 mo.) Reduplicated Babbling: (canonical babbling) True syllables present. Same consonant-vowel sequence [dada], [baba].
  - Nonreduplicated Babbling: Different combinations. Prosody becomes noticeable.
    - Jargon babies vs. word babies
- Babbling drift: 6mo: the sounds that babies produce are somewhat influenced by the ambient language. 6mo: Phoneticians can tell which language a baby is babbling. 8mo: other people, more vowels, better carriers of intonation. 10mo: it becomes more difficult to tell because consonants are more noticeable. Also mechanical techniques are used to detect features of the ambient language in babbling.
    - At the end of the babbling stage: 10-12mo., clusters are rare, some vowels are more likely (schwa more frequent than [i] and [u]). Mostly single syllabic vocalizations with some bisyllabic vocs.
  - From Babbling to Words (14mo.): Babies are aware of difference but not able to distinct words. But in a sentence they are more difficult to distinguish. They have difficulty distinguising [dih] from [bih]. Around (18mo.) they do distinguish these sounds.

### Summary

The acquisition of phonology consists of learning to “distinguish and produce the sound patterns of the adult language”( Vihman, 1988a, p. 61). It also consists of learning and coming to mentally represent the structure underlying those sound patterns. As discussed in Chapter 3, the newborn can distinguish vocalic voiceless voiced stop virtually all the sounds all languages use, at least when the sounds are presented in isolation. The newborn produces no speech sounds, however. During the first year of life, speech sounds gradually emerge, beginning with vowel-like coos at 6 to 8 weeks of age, followed by some consonant sounds, followed by true babbling. The factors that underlie these developments include physical growth of the vocal apparatus, neurological development, and language experience. By the end of the first year, children are typically babbling sequences of syllables that have the intonation contour of their target language. 

Children’s productions are not adultlike. Initially, children appear to tackle the task of articulating words on a word-by-word basis. Around the age of18 months, children seem to develop systems for map-ping the phonemes in the target language to sounds within their own, more limited repertoires. Many of these mapping rules—or phonological processes—are common across children, giving all young children speech characteristic features, such as pronouncing bottle as /baba/orrabbitas/wæbIt/. The use of these processes declines gradually as children’s articulatory abilities develop. Also, which sounds are acquired early and which sounds appear later depends, to a degree, on how frequent those sounds are in input and on how important they are to marking distinctions in the target language. The full repertoire of speech sounds develops only gradually, with children typically sounding adultlike by about 7 years of age. 

When and how children achieve a mental representation of the underlying phonological system is a central topic in the study of phonological development. One view holds that phonological development is dis-continuous. According to this view, children’s early representations are not like the phonological representations of adults. Rather, children initially represent words as unanalyzed wholes and only later come to represent words as sequences of phonemes. The alternative view of phonological development as continuous holds that children mentally represent the phonetic features of words, and, in that respect, children’s systems are adultlike from the beginning. There exist several theoretical approaches to accounting for phonological development. They differ in the role they accord to innate linguistic knowledge, biologically based motor capacities, properties of input, and the child’s growing lexical knowledge.

### Review

1. How would you convince your friend, who claims to know nothing about phonology, that she knows the difference between voiced and voiceless consonants?
2. What is the difference between a speech sound(or phone) and a phoneme?
3. List and describe the five stages of prespeech vocal development.
4. Is babbling related to subsequent language development? What is the evidence and what might the underlying mechanism be?
5. Why is a normative description of the development of speech sounds (such as Figure 4.2) only a very rough description of phonological development?
6. What are the phonological processes? How are they significant?
7. Explain and contrast the views that phonological development influences lexical development and that lexical development influences phonological development. What influence might lexical development have on phonological development?
8. Articulatory complexity, frequency, and functional load have all been argued to influence the order in which speech sounds are produced by children. Explain each factor and how it would shape the course of phonological development.
9. How is phonological awareness different from knowing the phonological system of one’s language?
10. What evidence supports the view that biological processes influence phonological development?

## Lexical Development: Learning Words

### Class Notes

- Overextensions and underextensions.
- World learning correlates with the ability to segment words phonologically.
- Nouns are learned before verbs. But there is cross-linguistic variance here. In head-final languages verbs are more prominent. 
- Pronoun reversal error: Children thinks "you” is their name.
- Children starts to comprehend before to produce.

---

- A word includes a *meaning*, *category*, *sounds (form)*, *connotations*, *(optionally)* *a written form*.
- A word is a **symbol**, and it **refers**. 
- The first words appear 10-15 months, they are approximations of words in the target language and they are different from protowords (like *baba*). They are usually context bound (for instance, a child say *duck* to refer to their toy not actual ducks).
- Referential vs. context-bound
- A child’s first words might be referential rathet than context-bound. (A child might refer to other mothers as *mummy*, when this happens it is referential)
- Context-bound words become more referential by time.
- Around 18 months children acquire a volabulary of 50 words. (50-words stage)
- Nelson (1973) classified words into:
  1. Specific nominal such as *mommy, daddy, Rover*
  2. General nominals such as *dog, ball, milk, he, this*
  3. Action words such as *go, up, look*
  4. Modifiers such as *big*
  5.  … … …
- Since verbs are more complex, out of all, more context-bound verbs appear first such as *look, go, come,do* along with action that are part of child’s routine such as *eat, drink, kiss, sing*
- **Natural partitions hypothesis**: nouns refer to entities, verbs express the relationship among entities.
- **Relational relativity hypothesis**: Verbs do not naturally emerge from the structure of the word. For instance; *walk, run, drive* (manner-focused), *sp. salir (to exit), escalar (to go up), entrar (to enter)* (path-focused).
