# Language Acquisition

## Study of Language Development

…

##### Current Approaches

- Guided by what researchers think language is
  - <u>Language as social behaviour</u>: social interaction at different ages and to identify the factors that influence that developmental course.
  - Gender differences
  - Cultural differences in styles of language use
  - How children recount stories, negatiate conflicts, and tell jokes
  - How children choose which language to use in bilingiual situations
- **Nativist Approach**: The human capacity for language is a device residing in the human brain that takes

## Language Development

### Chapter 2: Biological Bases of Language Development

#### Language as a Human Universal

- Language is not merely something that humans can do if exposed to the right conditions but that **language is something that humans …**
- Language Creation:
  - **Pidgin**: Primitive grammar; vocab from one or two languages. Hawaiian Pidgin English
  - Creaole: 

- Younger is better for language complexity generation.

#### Common Basis of Language Creation and Acquisition

- Children are better in creating regularities out of data that is not totally regular.
  - Probably because of biological capability that is dedicated to it

#### The Human Vocal Tract and Language

- Our vocal tract is evolved to be better at language than other function.
  - For instance, the position of larynx is low in humans compared to other animals. This makes it easy for language production but also easy to choke.

#### The Human Brain and Language

- A human vocaltract is neither enough nor necessary for language. (Sign Languages)
- Language requires a human brain.
  - Neurolinguistics is the study of the relation of the brain to language functionaing.
  - Is there a language organ in the brain?

- Neuroanatomy:

  - Outer layer: the cerebral cortex
    - Controls hiher mental functions like reasoning, planning, langugage
  - Underneath, subcortical
    - Controls more primite function like eating breathing

  - Corpus Callosum
    - Contralateral connections between left and right hemispheres
    - Neural connections: thousands of interconnected neurons (i.e. neural cells) that fire together whe npresented with a particular stimulus or when accomplishing a particular task

##### Methods of Neurolinguistic Investigation

- Lesion method
- Split brain patiens: severed corpus callosum
