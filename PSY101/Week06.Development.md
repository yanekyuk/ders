## Week 6 & 7
# Development
### Summary
##### PRENATALIY: A WOMB WITH A VIEW
- Developmental psychology studies continuity and change across the life span.
- The prenatal stage of development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg, producing a zygote. The zygote, which contains cromosomes from both the egg and the sperm, develops into an embryo at 2 weeks and then into a fetus at 8 weeks.
- The fetal enviroment has important physical and psychological influences on the fetus. In addition to the food a pregnant woman eats, teratogens, or agents that impair fetal development, can affect the fetus. Some of the most common teratogens are tobacco and alcohol.
- Although the fetus cannot see much in the womb, it can hear sounds and become familiar with those it hears often, such as its mother's voice.
##### INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD: BECOMING A PERSON
- Infants have a limited range of vision, but they can see and remember objects that appear within it. They learn to control their bodies from the top down and from the center out.
- Infants slowly develop theories about how the world works. Piaget believed that these theories developed through four stages, in which children learn basic facts about the world, such as the fact that objects continue to exist even when they are out of sight, and the fact that objects have enduring properties that are not changed by superficial transformations. Children also learn that their minds represent objects; hence objects may not be as they appear, and others may not see them as the child does.
- Cognitive development also comes about through social interactions in which children are given tools for understanding that have been developed over millennia by members of their cultures.
- At a very early age, human beings develop strong emotional ties to their primary caregivers. The quality of these ties is determined both by the caregiver's behavior and child's temperament.
- People get along with each other by learning and obeying moral principles.
- Children's reasoning about right and wrong is initially based on an action's consequences, but as they mature, children begin to consider the actor's intentions as well as the extent to which the action obeys abstract moral principles.
- Moral judgements may be caused by our emotional reactions to the suffering of others.
##### ADOLESCENCE: MINDING THE GAP
- Adolescence is a stage of development that is distinct from those stages that come before and after it. It begins with a growth spurt and with puberty, the onset of sexual maturity of the human body. Puberty is occuring earlier than ever before, and the entrance of young people into adult society is occuring later.
- During this "in-between stage", adolescents are somewhat more prone to do things that are risky or illegal, but they rarely inflict serious or enduring harm on themselves or others.
- During adolescence, sexual interest intensifies, and in some cultures, sexual activity begins. Sexual activity typically follows a script, many aspects of which are standart across cultures. Although most people are attracted to members of the opposite sex, some are not, and research suggests that biology plays a key role in determining a person's sexual orientation.
- As adolescents seek to develop their adult identities, they seek increasing autonomy from their parents and become more peer-oriented, forming single-sex cliques, followed by mixed-sex cliques, and finally pairing off as couples.

### Q & A
- What are the three prenatal stages?
    - They are **germinal stage**, **embryonic stage**, and **fetal stage**.
- Why are human beings born with underdeveloped brains?
    - Because birth canal is too narrow to let a baby with an adult head through. Also, it is better to fit into enviroment after birth than to have a fully developed brain from the beginning. *It's not a bug, it's a feature*.
- How does the uterine environment affect the unborn child?
    - Through bloodstream it enables the fetus and the mother to exchange certain chemicals.
- What can a fetus hear?
    - Their mother's heartbeat, gastrointestinal sounds, and her voice.
- What do newborns see?
    - They can see 8 to 12 inches, or 20 to 30 centimeters. 
- Why are infants born with reflexes?
    - Reflexes the infants are born with allow newborns to find their mother's nipple and begin feeding. Nature took no chances and hardwired it into every one of us.
- In what order do infants learn to use parts of their bodies?
    - "Top-to-bottom", that is from head to the feet; and "inside-to-outside", that is from trunk to the hands and feet.
- What are the three essential tasks of cognitive development?
    - They are: (a) how the physical world works, (b) how their minds represent the world, and (c) how other minds represent the world.
- What happens at the sensorimotor stage?
    - Infant experiences world through movement and senses, develops schemas, begins to act intentionally, and shows evidence of understanding object permanence.
- When do children acquire a theory of object permanence?
    - They acquire it at about 4 months old.
- What distinguishes the preoperational and concrete operational stages?
    - The difference between these can be illustrated by Piaget's experiment. Children in preoperational stage falsely claims the number of eggs when eggs were removed from cups to be spread on table with gaps inbetween larger than of the cups thinking the eggs were greater in number. Concrete operational children, on the other hand, realize that the number of eggs are still the same. They understood that quantity is a property of a set of contcrete objects that does not change when an operation such as spreading out alters the set's appearance. **Children in preoperational stage fail to focus on more than one property.**
- What is the essential feature of the formal operational stage?
    - Abstract thinking.
- What does the false-belief task show?
    - False-belief task shows that 3-year-olds don't realize that other people don't know what they know. Children between the ages of 4 to 6 are usually able to realize this.
- Do children understand emotions better than beliefs?
    - Surprisingly, very young children who do not yet fully understand that others have different perceptions of beliefs do seem to understand that other people have different desires.
- Which children have special difficulty acquiring a theory of mind?
    - Autistic children and deaf children whose parents don't know sign language.
- What did Piaget get wrong?
    - Two things: transitions between stages happening at some exact moment and the ages in which these transitions occur. Transitions occur more gradually and more earlier that he realized.
- How does culture affect cognitive development?
    - For example, different number systems in different cultures result in that children who know more arbitrarily constructed number systems perform worse that the more rationally constructed ones.
- How does an infant identify the primary caregiver?
    - Infants send signals such as crying, gurgling, cooing, and making eye contact, or smiling to keep a "mental tally" of who responds more than the other. The one who responds the most is the primary caregiver of the infant.
- How is attachment assessed?
    - Through the test named **Strange Situation** which involves bringing a child  and his or her primary caregiver to a laboratory room and then staging a series of episodes, including ones in which the primary caregiver briefly leaves the room and then returns, while psychologists monitor the infant's reaction.
- How do caregivers influence an infant's attachment style?
    - There are correlations showing that highly sensitive caregivers' children are almost twice as likely to have a secure attachment. The reason to suspect that a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness are a cause of the infant's attachment style is that mothers who were trained t obe more sensitive has children who are more securely attached.
- According to Piaget, what three shifts characterize moral development?
    - First, moral thinking shifts from realism to relativism, from prescriptions to principles, from outcomes to intentions.
- What are Kohlberg's three stages of moral development?
    - Preconventional, conventional, and postconventional stages of moral development.
- What was Kohlberg right about and wrong about?
    - Other researchs suggest that stages of moral development are not as if they are skills, an individual may choose one of them for a particular situation.
- Do moral judgements come before or after emotional reactions?
    - Moral judgements are the consequences--and not the causes-- of emotional reactions. **After**.
- What happens when we see others suffer?
    - Research has shown that watching someone suffer activates the very same brains regions that are activated when we suffer ourselves.
- How does the brain change at puberty?
    - â€‹	
- How has the onset of puberty changed over the last century?
    - 
- Are adolescent problems inevitable?
    - 
- What makes adolescence especially difficult?
    - 
- Is sexual orientation a matter of nature or nurture?
    - 
- Why do many adolescents make unwise choices about sex?
    - 
- How do family and peer relationships change during adolescence?
