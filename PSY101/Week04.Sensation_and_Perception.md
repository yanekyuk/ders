## Week 4 & 5
# Sensation and Perception
### Summary
##### SENSATION AND PERCEPTION ARE DISTINCT ACTIVITIES
- Sensation and perception are critical to survive. Sensation is the simple stimulation of a sense organ, whereas perception organizes, identifies, and interprets sensation at the level of the brain.
- All of our senses depend on the process of transduction, which converts physical signals from the enviroment into neural signals carried by sensory neurons into the central nervous system.
- In the 19th century, researchers developed psychophysics, an approach to studying perception that measures the strength of a stimulus and an observer’s sensitivity to that stimulus. Psychophysicists have developed procedures for measuring an observer’s absolute threshold, or the smallest intensity needed to just barely detect a stimulus, and the just noticeable difference (JND), or the smallest change in a stimulus that can just barely be detected.
- Signal detection theory allows researchers to distinguish between an observer's perceptual sensitivity to a stimulus and criteria for making decisions about the stimulus.
- Sensory adaptations occurs because sensitivity to lengthy stimulation tends to decline over time.
##### VISION I: HOW THE EYESS AND THE BRAIN CONVERT LIGHT WAVES TO NEURAL SIGNALS
- Light passes through layers and reaches **retina** in which there two types of photoreceptors that turn light into neural impulses: **cones**, which operate under normal daylight and sense colours; and **rods**, which are active under low-light conditions for night vision. The neural impulses are sent along the **optic nerve** to the brain.
- Retina's outermost later consists of RGCs _(retinal ganglion cells)_ that collect and send signals to the brain. They form the **optic nerve**.
- When light strikes retina, it causes a specific pattern of response in each of three types of cones that are critical to color perception: short-wavelength (bluis), medium-wavelength (greenish), long-wavelength (reddish) light. Overall pattern of response across them results in an unique color.
- Information encoded by retina travels to the brain via the optic nerve, which connects the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex, area V1, in the occipital lobe.
- Two functionally distinct pathways project from the occipital lobe to visual areas in other parts of the brain. The **ventral system** travels into the lower levels of the temporal lobes and includes brain areas that represent an object's shape and identity. The **dorsal stream** goes from the occipital lobes to the parietal lobes, connecting with brain areas that identify the location and motion of an object.
##### VISION II: RECOGNIZING WHAT WE PERCEIVE
- Illusory conjunctions occur when features from seperate objects are mistakenly combined. According to feature-integration theory, attention provides the glue necessary to bind features together. The parietal lobe is important for attention and contributes to feature binding.
- Some regions in the occipital and temporal lobes respond selectively to specific object categories, supporting the **modular view** that specialized brain areas represent particular classes of objects such as faces or houses or body parts.
- The principle of perceptual constancy holds that even as sensory signals change, perception remains consistent. Gestalt principles of perceptual grouping, such as simplicity, clouse, and continuity, govern how the features and regions of things fit together.
- Image-based and parts-based theories each explain some, but not all, features of object recognition.
- Depth perception depends on: monocular cues, such as familiar size and linear perspective; binocular cues, such as retinal disparity; and motion-based cues, which are based on the movement of the head over time.
- We experience a sense of motion through the differences in the strengthsof output from motion-sensitive neurons. These processes can give rise to illusions such as apparent motion.
- Change blindness and inattentional blindness occur when we fail to notice visible and even salient features of our enviroment, emphasizing that our conscious visual experience depends on focused attention.

### Q & A
- What role does the brain play in what we see and hear?
    >   What we see and hear are our sensations, on the other hand, brain is responsible of perception. A person can have fully functional eyes, and yet be face-blind. **Sentation** and **perception** are related, but seperate, events.
- Why isn't it enough for psychophysicist to measure only the strength of a stimulus?
    >   It's another matter entirely to measure a person's psychological experience of that stimulus. 
- What is the importance of proportion to the measurement of just noticeable difference?
    >   It's the **Weber's Law**. For instance, if you picked up a 1 kilograms envelope, then a 2 kilograms envelope, you'd detect the difference, but first a 20kg and then 21kg, you'd probably not detect the difference.
- How accurate and complete are out perceptions of our world?
    >   Not much. Because of all the **noise** we sometimes don't perceive what we sense, perceive what we don't sense, vice versa.
- What conditions have you already adapted to today? Sounds? Smells?
    >   Stuff :/
- How do eyeglasses actually correct vision?
    >   Faulty vision is caused by a too long or short eyeball. Eyeglasses provide an additional lens to help focus light more appropriately.
- What are the major differences between rods and cones?
    >   Most notably in their numbers, and their clarity of images.
- What happens when the cones in your eyes get fatigued?
    >   For instance, when you view a green dot long enough, the cones responding to green gets fatigued over time. Right after this, if you look at a white or gray dot in which all the colors are equally represented, tired green cones don't respond and you see a tinted red instead.
- What is the relationship between the right and left eyes, and the right and left visual fields?
    > ...
- What are the main jobs of the ventral and dorsal streams?
    >   Ventral | Dorsal | -
    >    ---    |  ---   | -
    >   shape & idendity | motion | of objects
    >   what    | how   | pathway
- How does the study of illusory conjunctions help us understand the role of attention in feature binding?
    >   Attention provides the "glue" necessary to bind features together, and illusory conjunctions occur when it is difficult for participants to pay full attention to the features that need to be glued together.
- How do we recognize our friends, even when they're hidden behind sunglasses?
    >   It's because the visual system responds with "Interesting... here's a deviation from the way this face usually looks" rather that "Here's a new and unfamiliar face to perceive." Perception is sensitive to changes in stimuli, but **perceptual constancies** allow us to notice the differences **in the first place**.
- What is an important difference between template and parts-based theory of object recognition?
    >   Objects we saw before are stored in memories as templates, and when we see and object our memory compares the retinal image to a template to find out what it is. On the other hand, parts-based theory suggests that we recognize objects based on their parts, such as cars (4 wheel, 4 door, sterring wheel, seats etc.). There are problems for each, for instance, what if we see a cup upside-down and from top, we are still able to recognize the cup. Problem with the other is, face-detection, we can still recognize our friends even if many parts of their face has undergone big changes. 
- How can flashing lights on a casino sign give the impression of movement?
    >   It's the **apparent motion**. Flashing lights are able to evoke a strong sense of motion because we perceive a series of flashing lights as whole, moving objects. Video technology and animation depend on apparent motion also.
- How can a failure of focused attention explain change blindness?
    >   Change blindness mostly occur when people fail to focus attention on the changed object.
