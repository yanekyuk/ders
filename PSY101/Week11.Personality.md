### Summary

##### PERSONALITY: WHAT IS IT AND HOW IT IS MEASURED

- In psychology, personality refers to a person's characteristic style of behavior, thinking, and feeling.
- Personality psychologists attempt to find the best ways to describe personality, to explain how personalities come about, and to measure personality.
- Two general classes of personality tests are personality inventories, such has the MMPI-2-RF, and projective techniques, such as the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the TAT. Newer high-tech methods are proving to be even more effective.

##### THE TRAIT APPROACH: IDENTIFYING PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR

- The trait approach tries to identify personality dimensions that can be used to characterize an individual's behavior. Researchers have attempted to boil down the potentially huge array of things people do, think, and feel into some core personality dimensions.
- Many personality psychologists currently focus on the Big Five personality factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.
- To address the question of why traits arise, trait theorists often adopt a biological perspective, seeing personality largely as the result of genetic influences on brain functioning.

##### THE PSYCHO-DYNAMIC APPROACH: FORCES THAT LIE BENEATH AWARENESS

- Freud believed that the personality results from forces that are largely unconscious, shaped by the interplay among id, superego, and ego.
- Defense mechanisms are methods the mind may use to reduce anxiety generated from unacceptable impulses.
- Freud also believe that the developing person passes through a series of psychosexual stages and that failing to progress beyond one of the stages results in fixation, which is associated with corresponding personality traits.

##### THE SELF: PERSONALITY IN THE MIRROR

- The self-concept is a person's knowledge of self, including both specific self-narratives and more abstract personality traits or self-schemes.
- People's self-concept develops through social feedback, and people often act to try to confirm these views through a process of self-verification.
- Self-esteem is a person's evaluation of self; it is derived from being accepted by others, as well as by how we evaluate ourselves by comparison to others. Theories proposed to explain why we seek positive self-esteem suggest that we do so to achieve perceptions of status, or belonging, or of being symbolically protected against mortality.
- People strive for positive self-views through self-serving biases and implicit egotism.
