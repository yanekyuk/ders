# Personality

- **Personality Trait**: a characteristic; a dispositional tendency to act in a certain way over time and across circumstances.
- Contemporary psychologists are primarily interested ...
- *Implicit personality theories*: We assume that certain personality characteristics go together; we make predictions about people based on minimal evidence.

### Trait Approaches Describe Behavioral Dispositions

- **Trait approach**: focuses on how individuals differ in personality dispositions, such as sociability,cheerfulness, and aggressiveness.
- **Personality types**: discrete categories of people based on personality characteristics
- Eysenck 3 Superordinate traits
- Cattell's (1965) *factor analysis* identified 16 basic dimensions of personality.
- CURRENT: FIVE FACTOR MODEL

### Eysenck's Hierarchical Model

- Hand Eysenck proposed a hierarchical model of personality
- The basic structure of this model included:
  - Specific response level
  - Habitual response level
- Superordinate traits
  - Introversion/extroversion
  - Emotional stability
  - Psychoticism

### The Big Five 

- **Five-factor theory**: identifies five basic personality traits (McCrae & Costa, 1999)
  - The "Big Five": openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism
  - For each factor, there is a continuum from low to high, each factor is a higher-order trait that is made up of interrelated lower-order traits
  - People's "scores" on the Big Five traits have been shown to predict a wide variety of different behaviors (e.g., conscientiousness predicts grades in college)
- The Big Five approach currently dominates how many psychologists study personality
- **Extroversion**: (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved). Energy, positive emotions, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extroversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extroversion linked with a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed.

- **Neuroticism**: (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident). The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, emotional stability.
- **Agreeableness**: (friendly/compassionate vs. analytical/detached). A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.
- **Conscientiousness**: (efficient/organized cs. easy-going/careless). A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior.
- **Openness to experience** : (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious). Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent, and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus.



### Arousal and Extroversion / Introversion

- Eysenck believed that differences in cortical arousal produce the behavioral differences between extroverts and introverts
- Cortical arousal, or alertness, is regulated bu the *ascending reticular activating system (ARAS)*
- Eysenck proposed that the system of reticular activation differs between extroverts and introverts, with the resting level of the ARAS higher for introverts that for extroverts.
  - The visible biological difference between introverts and extroverts appears to be their level of arousability, or how much they react to stimuli.
  - Introverts are more arousable.



### Behavioral Activation and Inhibition System

- Gray (1987) proposed that personality is rooted in two motivational functions: this *behavioral approach system* and the *behavioral inhibition system*:
  - **Behavioral approach system (BAS)**: consists of the brain structures that lead organisms to approach stimuli in pursuit of rewards; this is the **"go" system**.
  - **Behavioral inhibition system (BIS)**: Because it is sensitive to punishment, the BIS inhibits behavior that might lead to danger or pain; this is the **"stop" system**.
  - All people have both of these. Former enables an individual to take risks for the sake of having a positive outcome, latter blocks any risks.
  - Extrovert have a stronger BAS than BIS, which means extroverts are more influenced by rewards than by punishments.
- Imaging research shows that each of the Big Five personality traits is associated with different brain regions (DeYoung et al., 2010).



### Humanistic Approaches Emphasize Integrated Personal Experience

- **Humanistic approaches**: emphasize personal experience, belief systems, the uniqueness of the human condition, and the inherent goodness of each person. The propose that people seek personal growth to fulfill their human potential.
- **Self-actualization**: People seek to fulfill their potential for personal growth through greater self-understanding.
- Carl Rogers' **person-centered approach** emphasized the importance of people's subjective understanding of their lives.
- Encouraged parents to raise their children with **unconditional positive regard** so that they might become *fully-functioning* people.



### The Humanistic Perspective

- **Need for Positive Regard**: an inborn need for acceptance, sympathy, and love from others.
- **Unconditional Positive Regard**: communicates that the person is inherently worthy of love, regardless of accomplishments or behavior.



### The Humanistic-Existential Approach: personality as Choice

- Humanistic and existential theorists focus on how healthy choices create personality.
  - Humanistic psychologists emphasize a positive, optimistic view of human nature; goodness and ...
  - ...
- **Existential approach**: regards personality as governed by an individual's ongoing choices and decisions in the context of the realities of life and death; argued by *Rollo May* and *Victor Frank*.
  - **Angst** can arise as we find meaning in life and death and take responsibility for making free choices.
  - ...



### The Social Cognitive Approach: Personalities in Situations

- **Social cognitive approach**: Approach that views personality in terms of how the person thinks about the situations encountered in daily life and behaves in response to them.
- **Person-situation controversy**: Question of whether behavior is caused more by personality or by situational factors.
  - The situation and learning history are key determinants of behavior but are open to interpretation; how people perceive their environment.



### Personality Reflects Learning and Cognition

- **Cognitive-social theories of personality**: emphasize how personal beliefs, expectancies, and interpretations of social situations shape behavior and personality.
- **George Kelly**'s *personal constructs*: People have personal theories of how the world works.
- **Julian Rotter**'s *expectancy-value* approach: Internal/external locus of controls.
- **Mischel**'s *cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS*):
  - *Defensive pessimism*: people expect to fail.
  - *Self-regulatory capacities*: ability to set personal goals, evaluate, progress, and adjust behavior accordingly.

- **Personal constructs**: dimensions people use in making sense of their experiences; originally proposed by **George Kelly**.
  - Differences in perspective in the perceiver's personality; different construals are key to personality differences.
- **Perspective is also reflected in personal goals**.
  - *Outcome expectancies*: Person's assumptions about the likely consequences of a future behavior; combine with goals to produce characteristics style of behavior.



### Social-Cognitive Theories

- **Locus of control** is a generalized expectancy.
- People with an internal locus of control:
  - Behave in a more self-determined fashion
  - Achieve better grades
  - Are more resistant to social influence
  - Engage in more health-promoting behaviors; experience less depression and anxiety
- **Julian Rotter**:
  - Likelihood that we will engage in a particular behavior in a given situation is influenced by two factors:
    - Expectancy: our perception of how likely it is that certain consequences will occur.
    - Reinforcement Value: how much we desire or dread the outcome that we expect the behavior to produce.

- **Self-Afficacy (Albert Bandura)**: a person's beliefs concerning their ability to perform the behaviors needed to achieve desired outcomes.
