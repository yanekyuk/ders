# Research Methods
- Curiosity, skepcitism and open-mindedness are driving forces
  - Research ideas often come from observation
- Kitty Genovese Murder (**Genovese Effect**)
  - Altough everyody heard and saw the murder, no one acted before it was too late.
  - John Dawey? recreated the scene to observe the behaivour of poeple to find out the reason.
    - Seeing smoke getting in to the room, individuals respond but not when with other people. **
    - Responsibility diffuses when other people around.
- The Bystander Effect
  - Peter lies on the floor pretending to be ill, no bystander helps him. 
    - Ought to help vs. ought to do what everybody does
    - When another actor helps Peter, others join (finding themselves in other group)

### Steps in Sci. Process

```
Ask Questions
Do Background Research
Construch Hypothesis <----------------Try Again!
Test with an Experiment                   |
Analyze Results Draw Conclusion           |
Hypothesis is false or partially true -->
Hypothesis is true 
Report Result
```

#### Kitty's Murder
- Case of the Murder
- Gather info and form hypothesis (why people didn't call police)
- Test Hypothesis by conducting Research
- Analyze the hypothesis, lab tests etc.
- Report results (responsibilt diminishes when around people)

### Defining and Measuring Variables
- Operational Definition: defines a variable in terms of the specific procedures used to produce or measure it.
- For instnce: Measuring Exam Stress can be via biological, psycholoical or enviromental viewpoint.
- Slef reports and reports of others
- Measurement of overt behavior (imp of coding systems for reliablility
- Unobstrusive measurement (participant unaware)
- Archival Data ( birth reports, marriage records...)
- Psychological tests (peronality, intelligence...)
- Physiological measures (heart rate, hormone levels...)

### Methods of Research
1. **Descriptive Research:** seeks to identify how humans and other animals behave, particularly in nayural settings
2. **Correlational Research:** Relation (association) between two variables (# of lectures attended and exam performance)
3. **Experimental Research:** investigating the effect of a manipulation on an outcome while controlling for extraneous factors

#### I.E. Descritive Research
  - Case studies: an in-depth anaysis of an individual, group or event
    - [Phineas Gage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6kRp41ygrl)
    - Oliver Sacks - The Man who mistook his wife for a hat
  - Naturalistic Observation: the researcher observes behaivour as it occurs in a natural setting, and attempts to avoid influencing
  - Survey Research: information about a topic is obtained by administering questionnaries or interviews to many people
    - A populitaion consists of all the individuals that we are interested in drwaing a conclusion from
    - A sample is a subset of indivi. drawn from the larger population
      - A representative sample is one that reflects the characteristics of the population
      - Random sampling, unrepresentitive
    - Identifying population's characteristics _ie. marketing_
 
#### I.E Correlational Research
  - Researcher measures one variable (x)
  - Researcher measures a second var (y) 
  - Researcher statistically determines whether (X) and (Y) are related (correlated)
  - Positive / negative correlation?
  - **Correlation != Causation**
    - Better social relationshipts - Greater Happiness
    - X causes Y or Y or causes X (1) or are they not caused by each other but by another variable(2)?
    - **bidirectionality problem** (1) or **third variable problem** (2)?
    - **Correlation Coefficient**: direction + strength of a correlation.
      - Varies from -1 to 1
      - Close to +/- 1: correlation gets stronger
      - Positive Corr: > 0, Negative Corr: < 0
    - __Scatterplots__: a graph that show the correlation between two variables

#### I.E Experimental Research 
  - Researcher manipultes one or more variables
  - Researcher measures whether this manipulation influences other vars
  - Researcher attemps to control extraneous factors that migth influence the outcome
  - Exp. Effect of using a phone while driving on driving performance
    - Manipulation is the phone (independent), outcome is the driving performance (dependent)
```
Sample of participants (randomly assigned after)
Experimental Group (with phone) / Control Group (without phone)
Measure something (measure braking reaction time)
Statistically analyze the performance of the two groups
```
#### Analyzing and Interpretting Data 
- Better to remove unnecessary data. (if max value is 30, graph should end around 30 not 100)
  1. Descriptive Statistics: statistics summarize and describe the chatracteristics of a set of data
     - Mode, Median, Mean
     - Range, Standart Deviation, 
  2. Inferential Statistics: tell us how confident we can be in making inferences about a population based on findings obtaup?ined from a sample
      - Statistical significance means that it is very unkikely that a particular finding occured by chance alone
      - Is the treatment group has significally lower depression scores that the control gro
