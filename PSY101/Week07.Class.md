## Week 8
# Social Psychology
- Humans are ultra-social: **cooperation** and **aggression**
- **Aggression**:
    - Negative emotions like anger cause it
    - Man show more aggression
    - Culture also affects standarts of aggression.
- **Cooperation**:
    - Trust is key in cooperation, people do not like being cheated
    - People form groups (feeling of inclusion is beneficial)
        - Groups are bad at decision-making
        - Groups can lead people to do terrible things (deindividualation & diffusion of responsiblity)
    - Altruism: people help each ocher...
        - ...
- Other types of sociality: **romantic/sexual relationship**
    - How we choose our mates depends on cultural norms
        - Women tend to be choosier
    - Physical appearances matters in attraction
        - Some attractive features ...
    - **Attraction**: Standarts of beauty can vary across cultures. Mauritanian women long to be obese. Ghanian men short.

#### Survival: The Struggle for Resources
- **Aggression**: Purposefully harming another person.
- **Frustration-agression hypothesis**:Animals agress only when their goals are blocked
- **Negative affect (emotion)** may cause aggression
    - But not all kinds, e.g., disgust
> As the temperature increases, the likelihood of Team B players to hit Team A players on the field increases etc. **Why? People feel uncomfortable when it is too hot! Negative feelings -> aggression.**
- **Men** show more aggression than women
    - 90% of the murders and 80% of the violent crimes in the United States.
    - Socialization and testosterone may be causes.
    - Threatening status and/or dominance is a key trigger of aggression.
    > Subjects who were given testosterone were less likely recognize angry facial expressions. Failing to recognize that someone is getting angry can lead you end up in a fight!
- **Culture** affects standarts of aggressive acts.

**Under what circumstances do women aggress?**
- Women's aggression is usuallyless impulsive & more calculated. The purpose is to protecting a resource. They tend to aggress when provoked.
- Women may also aggress by causing social harm (as opposed to physical)

**Has the human species become less aggressive over time?**
- ...

#### Cooperation
- **Cooperation**: Behavior by two or more individuals that leads to mutual benefit
> The Prisoner'S Dilemma
- People try to minimize risk by detecting cheating.
> **The Ultimatum Game**: Player 1 needs to divide a prize into two, if the Player 2 accept the offer, they both win their share, if she rejects the offer, they win nothing. If Player 2 perceives their share as unfair, they do not accept it -> no coop to punish cheater
---
**Who can we trust?: Groups**
- **Group**: Collection of people who have something in common that distinguishes them from others.
    - **Inclusion** in groups creates a feeling of belonging and promotes wee-being.
    - People favor members of their group over strangers, even if they are randomly assigned to a meaningless group.
- **Prejudice**: Positive or negative _evaluation_ of another person because of their group membership.
- **Discrimination**: Positive or negative _treatment_ of another person because of their group membership.
---
##### Negative Aspects of Groups
- Groups are not better at making decisions than individuals.
    - **Common Knowledge Effect**: Groups focus too much on info that everyone already knows. (usually unimportant)
    - **Group polarization**: Groups makemore extreme decisions than individuals - during the discussion, people hear many arguments in favor of the same position.
    - **Groupthink**: Reaching a bad decision just to maintain group harmony.
- **Deindividuation**: people may become less aware of their personal values when they get immersed in a group, which causes them to do bad things.
    - Losing your individual identity.
- **Diffusion of responsibility**: Individuals are less likely to take responsibility for an action when they are surrounded by others.
    - **Social loafing**: When a person puts very little effort in a group task, because she thinks other members will do the task anyways
    - **Bystander intervention**: When a person fails to help in an emergency situation...
> People can engange in horrible acts in groups, such as lynching, especially if the group is large (because of deindividuation & diffusion of responsibility)
---
**Would you save a research mouse from death?**
- Participants were aked to give up their payment for a study to save a mouse's life.
- When asked individually, 46% took the money and let the mouse die.
- When asked in pairs, 72% agreed to split the money with their partner and let the mouse die.
- Why? Because when people make joint decisions, each feels diminished responsibilty for it.
---
**If groups are bad, why do we need them?**
- Quality and number of group memberships predicts well-being.
    - People who are excluded from groups ...
- ...
---
#### Altruism
- Are we ever nice and helpful for no reason?
- **Altruism**: Behavior that benefits another without the intention of benefitting oneself.
    - **Kin selection**: Helping relatives to increase their chances of survival. **This is not altruistic. They are trying to spear teir genes**
    - People sometimes help complete strangers. **This may also not be altruistic. Reciprocal Altruism is the underlying reason**
---
**Are human beings ever truly altruistic?**
Maybe. We sometimes help strangers that we will ...

#### Other Types of Sociality: Sexual/Romantic Relationship
- Reproduction is an important goal for humans.
- How do we choose our sexual partners?
- Women tend to be choosier in selecting sexual partners.
    - Sex is a greater investment for women (possibility of pregnancy) than men (who have billions of sperm to spread), so women need to choose.
- Culture determines appropriate behaviors in mating
    - Reputational costs of having lots of partners are higher for women, so they may need to choos efew partners
    - Men are generally expected to approach women and make the first move, which puts women in the chooser position.
> In an experiment, either men or women remained seated and were approached by the other gender. Being in the "approached" position made people (both men and women) cautious, and thus pickier (less likely to share their phone numbers)

#### Attraction
- **Attraction** (evoking feelings of interest or liking) is caused by situational, physical, and psychological factors
- **Proximity** (physical closeness) fosters liking
    - We can only choose friends/partners from among the people that we have met!
    - We tend to like people we see around all the time. **Mere exposure effect**: Liking increases with frequent exposure (not only for people, also ...)
> Usher probably prefers his mirrored-image, on the hand his followers would prefer not-mirrored-one
- People sometimes misinterpret feelings of **arousal** as attraction:
- **Physical attractiveness** is the major factor in attraction
- Culture defines beauty standarts! But there are some commonalities across cultures.
    - Body shape: inverted triangle for men, hourglass for women -> reflect testosterone & estrogen
    - Symmetrical face and young age
    - These features signal good genes & fertility, and potential for good parenthood
- **Physical attractiveness** also fosters favorable treatment in general.
    - We believe that beautiful people also have superior qualities
    - ...
> Research shows that tall people earn $789 more per inch per year! Tall men have a higher probability of earning high wages, possibly a result of preferential treatment due to attractivess.
- While we may desire the most attractive people, we tend to approach those who are similar to us in terms of level of physical attractiveness.
- "Opposites attract" may be a myth! We prefer partners who are psychologically similar to us
    - It's easier to talk to with people who are similar to us
    - We like it when someone shares our beliefs: we have greater confidence in our beliefs, and we feel better
    - We also think that if we like people similar to us, they are more likely to like us back
    - People tend to marry a partner with similar a level of education, religious background, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and personality
- Attraction is not only about physical attractiveness. Inner qualities also matter!
    - People consider intelligence, sense of humor, sensitivity, and ambition attractive as attractive qualities

#### Relationships
- Why do we form long-term relationships?
    - Our offspring needs parental care for a long period of time, similar to birds! (who also form committed relationships)
- Relationships are useful to care for children, but there is also a **cultural** aspect
- Marriage is the norm in many cultures. Why do people get married?
    - Love is one of the major reasons why people marry today.
    - 85% of Americans say they would not marry without love
    - However, this wasn't the case until about  tje 17th century for Westerners.
        - People married for other reasons (economic, political, etc.) throughout history
    - Two kinds of love:
        - **Passionate love**: Feelings of euphoria, intimacy, and intense sexual attraction. Brings people together
        - **Compassionate love**: Affection, trust, and concern for a partner's well-being. Keeps people together.
- **Social exchange**: People remain in relationships as long as they think there are more benefits than costs (cost-benefit ratio)
    - Possible benefits: love, sex, not being alone, financial security
    - Possible costs: responsibility, conflict, loss of freedom
- Whether a person will stay in a relationship or not also depends on:
    - **Comparison level**: Do I deserve more benefits? Do I have better alternatives? Can I find another relationship with more benefits?
    - **Equity**: People prefer the cost-benefit ratios of the two partners to be equal.
    - **Sunken-cost**: If you have invested in a relationship, you become more likely to stay in it, even if the benefits aren't much. 
        - New marriages are more likely to end than old ones.

#### Social Influence
- Ability to influence another person's behavior.
    - Three basic motivations which make people susceptible to social influence: **Hedonic, approval, and accuracy**
- **Hedonic motive**: Pleasure is better than pain
    - **Pleasure-seeking** is the most basic of all motives: we seek pleasure (positive feelings) and avoid pain.
    - **Rewards (+) and punishments (-)** can influence behavior.
    - However, rewards and punishments can backfire!
    > In a study, researchers gave little children pens to play with: Some children were later given an award for playing with pens. The next day, those who were previously awarded chose NOT to play with the pens. What happened? Kids started thinking that drawing something you do to receive awards, not something you do just for fun!
    > Researchers places signs of two restrooms on a college campus: "Please don't write on these walls." and "Do not write on these walls under any circumstances.". Two weeks later, which restroom had more writings? People did not like the more tone of the second message and wrote on the walls just to prove they could.
- **Approval motive**: The quest for inclusion, to be accepted
    - **Norm**: Customary standard for behavior that is widely shared by members of a culture.
        - **Norm of Reciprocity**: people should return favors. For instance, waiters at restaurants sometimes give customers a piece of candy with the bill. Receiving this little gift may make you leave a bigger tip!
        - **Door-in-the-face Technique**: I ask you a big favor. You say no, then I change my request and ask you a smaller favor. Now you are more likely to say yes! For instance, researchers asked students "Would you volunteer to supervise adolescents on a field trip?" 17% agreed. Then researchers used tihs technique: they first asked, "Would you volunteer at a youth detention center for 2 hoursa a week for 2 years" Everyone said no. Then they asked the first question 50% agreed.
    - Other people define the norms!
    - **Normative Influence**: another person's behavior provides information about what is appropriate in a given context. For example, if you best friend becomes obese, you chance of becoming obese increases 171 percent. Definition of what's normal changes according to one's social circle.
    - **Conformity**: The tendency to do what other people are doing. Whe sometimes follow other people just to be included and accepted. This can happen even if don't believe what they're doing is right. For instance; in a research, people asked to say out loud which line on the right is the same length as the one on the left. However, only one person is a real participant, the others are actors hired by the experimenter! Actors consistently give the wrong answer to the question. When the real participant's turn comes, what is he going to say? The research participants tend to conform and also give the wrong answer, even if the right answer is obvious! A busker's tip box and an electric bill showing that the neighbour's usage is way lower than one's usage are good examples of **conformity at work**.
    - Social norms used in campaigns:
        - Binge (heavy) drinking on college campuses is an important problem. Students overestimate the amount their peers drink (they think their friends drink a lot). They may think that heavy drinking is the norm. A campaign used posters that said: "Most college students only drink moderately". Heavy drinking fell in the first year and similar results persisted for nearly a decade. Students do what they think the other students are doing!
    - **Obedience**: Tendency to do what powerful people tell us to do. This happens when a person of authority explicitly tells us to do something. Stanley Milgram's Obedience Study: Participants were told: "There is a 'learner' in the other room, and you will be the 'teacher' in this study. You will ask the learner questions, and every time the learner gives a wrong answer, you will administer an electric shock by pressing a button. You will increase the shock .... .". Participants start by administering a small (15V) shock, and increase it with every mistake. At 75V, the person in the other room screams in pain. At 150V, the person screams "Let me out, I have a heart problem." At 300V, .... Most participants are disturbed by this and want to stop, but the experimenter says, "You have no choice, you must continue." Many participants obeyed the experimenter, and agreed to give very dangerous levels of electric shock to another one. 80% of participant continued to shock the learner even after he screamed , complained, pleaded... 62% went all the way, delivering highest possible voltage.
    - What wrong with people? The are just normal people. People obey due to normative pressure: the experimenter is in charge (has authority), and is believed to know what is appropriate in this situation. Obedience rates decrease when the experimenter does not wear a lab coat. Lab coat signals authority and knowledge.
- **Accuracy motive**: Right is better that the wrong
    - We form attitudes and beliefs nd we tend to follow them. **Attitude**: Positive or negative evaluation of an object or event. **Belief**: Piece of knowledge about an object or event.
    - We want our attitudes and beliefts to be accurate! 
    - **Informational influence**: Another person's behavior provides information about what is true. If everyone suddenly starts running at a mall screaming "Fire!!!", what would you do? You would most likely also start running. Not because you wat to be included or accepted, but because people's behavior provides informations. Why do sitcoms use laughing sounds after jokes?
    - **Persuasion**: Person's attitudes or beliefs are influenced by a communication other person. Two types of persuation: **Systematic Persuasion**: Changing attitude by logic and reason (strong arguments) | **Heuristic Persuasion**: Changing attitude by appealing to habit and emotion. (colors, music, status, attractiveness). When thinking deeply **systematic**, when not **heuristic persuasion** works better.
    - For example: In a research, people who have high motivation on a topic, whether the (same) argument was generated by a princeton professor or a high school teacher they agreed to the strong argumenti and not to the weak argument. People who don't have interest in the subject though, believed princeton professors' arguments whether it is strong or not, not high schoolers' arguments.
    
#### Persuation and Consistency
- **Foot-in-the-Door technique**: A small request followed by a lerger one. People tend to accept the larger after the smaller because of their urge to be consistent. Experimenter went to a neighbourhood asked homeowners to if they would put up a **big ugly sign** saying **Drive Carefully**. 17% accepted. A second group first asked them to sign a petition to promote safe driving, people accepted, then asked to put up the same sign. This time 55% percent said yes.
- **Foot-in-the-door** ve **Door-in-the-face**. Reasons for these are **Consistency** and **Reciprocity**.

#### Cognitive Dissonance
- Inconsistency between people's actions and attitudes or beliefs creates an uncomfortable feeling.
- People like balance! Remember the saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend".
- You may feel _dissonance_ if you do or say something you don't believe in, or if you put too much effort into something that's not worth it. For instance, completing an embarassing task to be able to join a group, but only to find out the group is boring.
- People try to fix dissonance, because it causes discomfort. 
- After completing a **very boring task**, two groups of people were rewarded 1$ and 20$. They were asked to report how much they liked the test. Ones who were rewarded 1$ liked more! Because the behavior of not liking the test is not justified by small payment. Being paid 20$ is justified not to like the test.

#### Social Cognition: Understanding People
- What does the medial prefrontal cortex do?
    - Processes information about people's attributes
    - This part of the brain is always switched on.
- Your brain is constantly making inferences about other people's thoughts, feelings, beliefs, desires, abilities, intentions etc.
- **Social cognition**: Processes by which people come to understand each other.
    - Based on (1) the categories to which they belong and (2) the things they do and say

#### Social Categorization and Stereotyping
- We assign people to social categories like race, gender, age etc.
- We associate these categories with certain traits and characteristics.
- **Stereotype**: Set of traits associated with members of a category.
- **Stereotyping**: Drawing inferences about others based on the categories in which they belong.
- Stereotypes are useful: they help organize the world around us, and help us make quick judgements.
- Stereotypes are harmful: they tend to be inaccurate, because they are exaggerated generalizations about people in a group, cannot be applied to every individual.
- A rare negative act is easier to remember than a common one.
- Stereotypes can be **overused**.
- Categorization affects our perception: We perceive categories as uniform
- Stereotypes are constantly reproduced.
    - **Perceptual confirmation**: We interpret information to confirm our stereotypes.
    - **Subtyping**: When we encounter someone that does not fit the stereotype, we put them in a sub-category rather than changing the stereotypes.
        - Stereotype: Gay men are feminine. I just saw a gay man who was very masculine. Instead of changing the stereotype, I create a subtype of gay men in my mind.
    - **Self-fulfilling prophecy**: People end up confirming their expectations because of their own actions.
        - **Stereotype threat**: The fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group can lead to lower performance.
- Stereotyping can be automatic
    - Can occur unconsciously or out of awareness
    - We _implicity_ associate certain social categories with certain characteristics
        - For instance, black men are associated with violence
        - We learn these associiations autmatically
    - Participants play a video game. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible to "shoot" or "don't shoot" a person depending on whether he is dangerous or not. If he is holding a gun, SHOOT. If not, DON'T SHOOT. Participants tended to shoot black men who were not holding a gun, and not shoot white men who were actually holding guns.
