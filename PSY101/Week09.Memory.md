# Memory

### Summary

##### ENCODING: TRANSFORMING PERCEPTIONS INTO MEMORIES

- Encoding is the process of transforming into a lasting memory the information our senses take in. Most instances of spectacular memory performance reflect skillful use of encoding strategies rather than so-called photographic memory. Memory is influenced by the type of encoding we perform regardless of whether we consciously intend to remember an event or a fact.
- Semantic encoding, visual imagery encoding, and organizational encoding all increase memory, but they use different parts of the brain to accomplish that.
- Encoding information with respect to its survival value is a particularly effective method for increasing subsequent recall, perhaps because our memory systems have evolved in a way that allows us to remember especially well information that is relevant to our survival.

##### STORAGE: MAINTAINING MEMORIES OVER TIME

- There are several types of memory storage:
  - Sensory memory holds information for a second or two.
  - Short-term or working memory retains information for about 15 to 20 seconds.
  - Long-term memory stores information anywhere from minutes to years or decades.
- The hippocampus and nearby structures play an important role in long-term memory storage, as shown by the severe amnesia of individuals such as HM. The hippocampus also is important for memory consolidation, the process that makes memories increasingly resistant to disruption over time. Sleep contributes importantly to memory consolidation.
- Memory storage depends on changes in synapses, and long-term potentiation (LTP) increases synaptic connections.

##### RETRIEVAL: BRINGING MEMORIES TO MIND

- Whether we remember a past experience depends on whether retrieval cues are available to trigger recall. Retrieval cues are effective when they are given in the same context as when we encoded an experience. Moods and inner states can serve as retrieval cues.
- Retrieving information from memory has consequences for later remembering. Retrieval improves subsequent memory of the retrieved information, as exemplified by the beneficial effect of testing on later recall. However, retrieval can impair subsequent remembering of related information that is not retrieved. It can also change the subsequent remembering when novel information is associated with vivid recollections.
- Retrieval can be separated  into the effort we make while trying to remember what happened in the past and the successful recovery of stored information. Neuroimaging studies suggest that trying to remember activates the left frontal lobe, whereas successful recovery of stored information activates the hippocampus and regions in the brain related to sensory aspects of an experience.

##### MULTIPLE FORMS OF MEMORY: HOW THE PAST RETURNS

- Long-term memory consists of several different forms. Explicit memory is the act of consciously or intentionally retrieving past experiences, whereas implicit memory refers to the unconscious influence of past experiences on later behavior and performance, such as procedural memory and priming. Procedural memory involves the acquisition of skills as a result of practice, and priming is a change in the ability to recognize or identify an object or a word as the result of past exposure to it.
- People who have amnesia are able to retain implicit memory, including procedural memory and priming but they lack explicit memory.
- Episodic memory is the collection of personal experiences from a particular time and place, it allows us both to recollect the past and imagine the future. Semantic memory is a networked, general, impersonal knowledge of facts, associations, and concepts.
- Collaborative memory refers to remembering in groups. Collaborative remembering can both impair memory (collaborative inhibition) and enhance it by exposing people to new information and helping to correct errors.

##### MEMORY FAILURES: THE SEVEN SINS OF MEMORY

- Memory's mistakes can be classified into seven sins.
- Transience is reflected by a rapid decline in memory followed by more gradual forgetting. With the passing of time, memory switches from detailed to general. Both decay and interference contribute to transience. Absentmindedness results from failures of attention, shallow encoding, and the influence of automatic behaviors, and is often associated with forgetting to do things in the future. Blocking occurs when stored information is temporarily inaccessible, as when information is on the tip of the tongue.
- Memory misattribution happens when we experience a sense of familiarity but don't recall, or mistakenly recall, the specifics of when and where an experience occurred. Misattribution can result in eyewitness misidentification or false recognition.Suggestibility gives rise to implanted memories of small details or entire episodes. Suggestive techniques such as hypnosis or visualization can promote vivid recall of suggested events, and therapists' use of suggestive techniques may be responsible for some individuals' false memories of childhood traumas. Bias reflects the influence of current knowledge,beliefs, and feelings on memory or past experiences. Bias can lead us to make the past consistent with the present, exaggerate changes between past and present, or remember the past in a way that makes us look good.
- Persistence reflects the fact that emotional arousal generally leads to enhanced memory, whether we want to remember experience or not. Persistence is party attributable to the operation of hormonal systems influenced by the amygdala. Although each of seven sins can cause trouble in our lives, they have an adaptive side as well.
- You can think of the seven sins as costs we have to pay for benefits that allow memory to work as as it does most of the time.
