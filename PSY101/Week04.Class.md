## Week 4 & 5
# Sensation and Perception

- Accuracy of the inner representations are relies on **baseline activity**, **signal to noise ratio**. There are noises both **in the nervous system** such as **the noise in the action potential** and **variance in the light intensity**.
- There are two types of signal processing in the visual system:
    - **Bottom-up Processing**: Processing that is based on incoming data. *Without incoming data, there is no perception.*
    - **Top-down Processing**: Processing that is based on knowledge (past experiences, world knowledge etc.) _Rat man stimulus_

- Ambigious figures are **mutually exclusive** meaning that we can perceive only one at a time because perception is constructive and one model can fit ...

- Perception is not solely based on the light entering the eye.
    - ...
    - ...
- Constructivism ask how the physical energy received by the sense organs forms the basis of perceptual experience. (_i.e., how the sensory system is converted into perception of cars, streets, buildings, sounds, smells, tastes etc._)
- **Richard Gregory**: External world can not be directly perceived because of the poverty of the information in the retinal image. Poverty of the ... means:
    - ...
- **Hermann von Helmholtz**: ~unconscious inferences >> inductive conclusions~
    - **induction**

#### The Perception Process: Knowledge High-Level Vision
Each retinal image could have arisen from any of a vast number of possible ...

- Top-down processes in the visual systems. Example below suggests that one perceptional solution overrides the other.

#### Clinical Cases
1. Patient LM _Zihi et al. 1983 (Akinetopia / Motion Agnesia)_
    - A 42 years old female - stroke
    - Bilateral lesions in the lateral temporo-occipital cortex and associated white matter
    - Her impairment was limited to an inability to perceive motion.
    - "She couldn't stop pouring at the right time since she was unable to perceive the movement in the cup when the fluid rose."
2. Mr. I. _(Sacks, 1995)_ - Cerebral Achromatopsia
    - Identifying himself as a "rather succesful artist"
    - Automobile accident / Injury to his occipital lobe.
    - Lost his ability to experience colours.
    - No abnormalities in the cells of eye's retina.
    - "My dog is gray. Tomato juice is black. Color TV is a hodge-podge..."

> The hallmark of the visual machinery is a complex division of the labour which is manifested anatomically in discrete cortical areas specialised for particular visual functions. - (Zeki, 1992)

#### Binding Problem
> How information Related to Different Attributes Are Combined?
- Cortical visual areas are interconnected in a complicated way.
- Information is shared among diffrent cortical areas:
    - **Feedforward** from lower to higher brain areas | **Basis of bottom-up process**
    - **Feedback** from higher to lower brain areas | influence signals flowing into the system | **basis of top-down process**
- Altough there is a main segregation in the visual system, different areas which process different attributes of the visual signal talk yo each other to combine the information they hold.

#### Where and What Pathways
- Dorsal Pathway (where) parietal lobe | Difficulty in solving the landmark problem
    - Responsible for: determining an object's location
- Ventral Pathway (what) temporal lobe | ...
    - Responsible for: ...

#### What and How Pathways
- ventral stream: perceiving objects (similar to what pathway)
- dorsal stream: ...

#### The Neural Correlates of Consciousness
> Whether the activity in the functionality specific brain areas are also crucial in evoking the consciousness or the awareness of this attribute.
- Similar pattern of firing during visual presentation of the same objects.
