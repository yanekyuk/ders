## Week 3 & 4
# Evolution and Behaviour
### Outline
- Historical perspectives on the social Nature of Humans and Animals
- Darwin's Theory of Evolution
  - The mechanism of evolution
  - Taxonomies during Darwin's time and later
  - The Homini line (i.e. evolution within homo genus)
  - Critical concrete aspects regarding evolutionary theory
  - Critical conceptual aspects reharding evolutionary theory
- Post-Darwin
  - Genetics
  - Ethology
  - Behavioral Genetics
- Aggression
    - Sex differences: Hormones (testosterone)
    - When do we see acts of aggression?
        - Defending hunt/prey
        - Defending territory (access to food, access to female, less attacks from other males)
        - Fighting for female -> importance of dominance hierarvhy (threat displays, appeasement displays)
- Mating
    - Courtship Rituals (advertising for a mate, ensuring within-species candidate)
    - Which sex makes the final decision?
        - The one that invests more -> the female

### Darwin's Theory of Evolution (1859)
- Trip to Galapagos Islands near Ecuador in South America
- English vs. Galapagos finches (birds)
- He starts drawing the animal that don't exist in England
- By the shape of the beaks of the birds in Galapagos, and other aspects, he realized the similarities.
- He decides to check their eating habit. (nuts vs. nectars) **Natural Variability**
- Gauss Graph?
- Artificial Selection
- Malthus' Population on **competition for limited resources...**
- birth of the idea of **natural selection**

### Artificial Selection
- By domesticaing animals (sheep, dog, horse etc.)
- Through ten thousand years of domestication a lot of sub-species emerged.
- **Species are not artificial, sub-species are.**
 
### Historical Perceptions on Human Nature
- Malthus' Population (1798) book
```
  population -> exponental
  resources -> linear
  therefore, struggle for existence is inevitable
```

### Natural Selection
In the struggle for existence, those will survive and propagate best that best adapt to their enviroment, be it thanks to their special **physical or behavioral characteristics**
- Alene frequency?
- **Evolution:** change in gene frequencies ...

### Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) Taxonomic Classification System
- Carl realizes similarities between animateds. | 
`Kingdom -> Phylum -> Class -> Order -> Family -> Species -> Latin Translation`

### The Wrong vs. The Right Theory
The drawing ın the right is only an approximation. The actual homini tree of ancestry is shown in the next slides...

The main point here is that the common ancestor of chimpanzees and homini goes back by many million years and that ancestor is neither human nor monkey...

Hominidae sub-species can understand mirror image. (self-awareness)

### Critical Concrete Aspects Regarding Evolution Theory
1. Change vs. no change over time
    - Physical or behavioral changes will only occur if crucial for basic survival and reproduction.
    - For the majority of non-mammal species there was no need for change since they continued to survive perfectly
2. Imperfections
    - There is no goal in evolution, it just works blindly based on whatever changes happen to improve survival & reproductive success in a given place & time
    - Oftentimes these changes create far from perfect **solutions**
3. Fossil Records
    - Tracing ancestry based on morphological (='yapısal') similarities, but...
    - Advances in molecular biology & genetics, make now DNA fossil tracing & ancestry reconstruction possible, which provide more accurate info...
4. Common DNA in all species
    - Tracing ancestry is no longer simply based on morphologicalsimilarities but on much finer molecular similarities such as genome profile & synthesized proteins.
5. First Experimental Studies & Results
    - since 1970s
    - Example: Two Lizard Studies
    - 14-yr (1977-1991) Bahamian Islands
    - 36-yr (1971-2007) Adriatic Islands
    - Take a lizard from main island to smaller ones, and observe the changes in lizards.
    - Second hypothesis is foreseeing the exact change. The lizards that were taken to as island with thick bushes, were expected to have changes in leg morphology (limp leg). 
### Critical Conceptual Aspects Regarding Evol. Theory
- Origin of Species != Origin of Life
- Epistemology of Science != Epistemology of Religion
- Meaning of "Theory" (e.g., Relativity Theory)
- Debates & different approaches within the evolutionary perspective
Is there or will there be evolutionarychange sice homo sapiens?
- Prebiotic Soup
    - Hidrogen, Amonium, Methane, CO2
- Stanley Miller; test the theory of life. He brought about synthesis of aminoacid. Today, people synthesies insufficients RNAs.
### Genetics (1870 - ...)
- **1865**: **Mendel** discovers **basic principle heredity** for physical characteristics such as eye colour, height etc.
- **1902**: Discovery of the chromosome as carrier of genetic information
- **1953**: **Watson & Crick**
    - Double helix structure of **DNA**
    - **Genes** are segments of DNA
    - Genes are recipes for **protein synthesis**
- **1990-1999**: **Human genome project**
    - Discovery that humans & chimpanzees share ~99% of their genes.
- ...
### Ethology (1930 - ...)
Careful scientific observation of natural animal behaviour with a certain amount of experimentation.
Trying to answer:
1. How a given behavior develops?
2. How it is triggered?
3. What is its function?
4. Why it developed? 
**Examples of Fixed ACtion Patterns:** Human babies grab fingers. 

### Behavioral Genetics (1990s - ...)
- Study of heritability of behavioral characteristics (e.g., extroversion, agression)
- Method of Study:
    - **twin studies**
    - **artifical selection/breeding studies**: breeding "bright" and "dull" rats by selective mating of fast learners with fast learners and slow learners with slow ones...
