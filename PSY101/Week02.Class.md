##### Genetics Basics
- Most cells have a nucleus that has a DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.
- DNA > double helix, contains genetic info denoted by **nucleotides**.
- Human DNA: about 3 billion nucleotides, packed intop 23 pairs of **chromosomes** ...
- ...
##### Gene-Enviroment Interactions (GxE)
- Genetic factor
- Enviromental factor
- Outcome
- Phenotypes does not have to be a disease
  - Endophenotypes:
  ```
  - Gene _____________________________________
  - Protein                                  |
  - Cellular system & signaling pathway      | Endophenotypes
  - Neural System dysfunction                |
  - Congnitive Dysfunction                   |
  - Symptoms_________________________________|
  - Syndrome
  ```
##### The Brain and Behaviour
- Cells -> Tissues -> Organs -> Systems
- Nerve cell (Neuron)
- Communication between neurons
- The Brain and Behaviour

##### Resting membrane potential
- _Ion_: positively or negatively charged atom (NA+, Cl-)
- _Ion Channels_ on the neuron membrane allow the passage of ions in and out of the cell.
- Inside of the cell is more negativelt charged than outside, leading to a negative resting potential (~ -70mV)
- Inside more K+, outside more Na+
##### Action Potential
- _Action Potential_: rapid charge in membrane potential as a result of stimulation ('firing of the neuron')
- _All-or-None-Law_:

##### Myelin Sheath
- **Myelin Sheath**: a layer of fatty insulation around the axons
  - **Faster Conduction**
  - Nodes of Ranvier
  - Multiple Sclerosis

##### Crash Course Stuff
- **The Old Brain** (Inner Core of the Brain) still performs for us as much as it did for our evolutionary ancestors. It consists of:
  - **Brain Stem**, the most ancient and central core of the brain where the spinal brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base of the skull is:
  - **Medula** is on autopilot, manages beating of heart, breathing of lungs,
  - **Pons** helps coordinate several other automatic functions.
  - **Thalamus** takes in sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting.
  - **Reticular Formation** is the network inside the brainstem that's essential for arousal. 
  - **Cerebellum** (little brain) is responsible for non-verbal learning and memory, the perception of time, and modulating emotions. This is affected by alcohol, hence the term tipsy.
- **Limbic System** (for higher function)
  - **Amygdala** consists of two bean sized clusters of neurons, involved in memory consolidation and emotion. For instance, fear.
  - **Hypothalamus** regulates body temperature, circadian rhytyms, and hunger, helps govern endocrine system. For instance, pleasure and reward.
  - **Hippocampus** is central to learning and memory, when damaged a person lose their ability to retain new information and memories.
- **Cerebrum** (Gray Matter) has the two hemispheres that make up about 85% of your brain weight, and oversee your ability to **think**, **speak**, and **perceive**.
- **Glial Cells** provide a spider web of support, that surround, insulate, and nourish the cerebral neurons.
- **Cerebral Cortex** consists of:
  - **Frontal Lobes** are involved in **speaking, planning, judging, abstract thinking,** and **personality aspects**
  - **Parietal Lobes** receive and process **sense of touch** and **body position**.
  - **Occitipal Lobes** receive **information related to sight**.
  - **Temporal Lobes** process sound, including speech comprehension
