## Week 6 & 7
# Development

#### Two Importnt Questions in Human Development
- 

#### Why are we interested in developmental research?
- How **nature** (biology) and **nurture** (enviroment) interact to produce development
- Long-term influences on later behavior
    - Those who don't eat the marshmellow -> more self-control?
    - Early intelligence -> lifelong achievement?
    - Childhood bullies -> adult criminals?
##### Marshmello Test
- A preeschool-age child is offered a choice
    - 1 piece provided now
    - 2 pieces if the wait

#### Prenatal Development: Conception to Birth
- **Germinal Stage**: (conception to 2 weeks)
    - Zygote: First cell of new life divides into two cells that then divide into 4 cells.
- **Embryonic Stage**:
    - 2 weeks to 2 months
    - Organs begin to form
- **Fetal Stage**:
    - 2 months to...

##### Teratogens
- Once the zygote is connected to the uterus, blood supply between moter and embryo
    - If something is in the mother's blood, it can cross over to the developing fetus
- Toxic enviromental agents that increase the risk of deviations in normal development -> birth defect
- First trimester is a vulnerable period
    - Serious consequences of alcohol, nicotine, rubella (kızamıkçık)
- Some organ systems (CNS) are sensitive to teratogens througout the entire pregnancy

##### Terminology
- **Newborn**: Birth to 1 month
- **Infant**: First year of life
- **Toddlerhood**: Second year
- **Preschoolers**: 3-5 years
- ...
- ...

##### Did you know?
- Babies are born with **100 billion neurons**
- Brain develops from 3mm brain tissue in the second week of pregnancy
- On average 250 thousand new neurons per min during pregnancy
- In the last trimester ...
- ...
- At birth, the brain has all the cells, yet it is 1/4 the size of an adult brain.

#### Perceptual, Motor, and Emotional Developmen in Infancy
##### Earliest Capabilities
###### Hearing
- Infants only minutes old will startle with a loud noise and may even cry
- Infants have been hearing noises from well before he was born
    - Mother's heartbeat, the gurgles of the digestive system, and her voice
- Hearing screening test before discharged from the hospital
- Infants can distinguish the sounds of the human voice from other kind of sounds, and see to prefer it.
    - Are particularly interested in "baby talk".
- At 2 months of age:
    - Present phoneme /pa/
    - **Habitutate** (return to baseline sucking rate)
    - New phoneme /ba/
    - **Dishabitutate**
###### Vision
- By 7 months babies can see as good as adults.
- Perception of faces:
    - Preference for patterned stimuli
###### Taste
- ...
- ...

#### Temperament
- Early appearing individual differences
- **Infant personality**
- ...

- **Reactivity**:
    - Onset: how quickly
    - Duration: how long
    - Intensity: how intense
- **Self-Regulation**:
    - One's ability to soothe
- Individual Differences in Emotionality:
    - Positive Effects
    - Fearfulness
    - Irritable Mood
- Genetic and Enviromental Influences on Temperament
    - Temperamental similarity of MZ versus DZ twins
    - Activity, irritability and positive effects:
        - Moderately heritable
    - Genetically-influences traits can be modified to some extent
        - Due to socialization experiences
        - due to life events that each child is exposed to

#### Definition of Attachment
- Child's emotional tie to the primary caregiver
- The quality of caregiver-child relations in the first year (Sensitive period)
    - Interactions with a sensitive, responsive caregiver 
- **TRUST** & **SECURE ATTACHMENT**
- **What does it mean to have a secure attachment relation?**
    - Caregiver acts as a **safe haven**: infant seeks **proximity & comfort** from caregiver
        - in times of distress, afraid, or sick
    - Caregiver acts as a **secure base for exploration**
        - Once soothed and comforted

#### Cognitive Development: Jean Piaget's Theory
- Processes by which children obtain and utilize knowledge
- Cognitive processes include:
    - ...
    - ...
- **Schemas**: organized mental patterns of knowledge. For example:
    - Things that fly => bird
    - In **assimilation**, new experiences are readily incorporated into existing schemas. When a child sees an airplane, he/she thinks it's a bird. Then =>
    - Things that fly may be => bird or plane or superman

##### Jean Piaget (1896-1980)
- Studied biology
- Turned to philosophy - epistemology
- Went to Paris to study psychology
- Under Alfred Binet administered IQ tests
---
##### Piaget's Theory
1. Series of stages
2. Distinct from of thinking
3. Chlidren's thinking changes **qualitatively** with age
---
**Constructivist**: Children construct their knowledge of the world through their activities.

- How do schemas change? How does the child advance cognitively?
    - Assimilation and accomodation

#### Piaget's Stages of Thinking
1. Sensorimotor Stage (birth to 2 years):
    - Infants understand their world primarily through sensory experiences and physical (motor) interactions with objects
    - **Object Permanence**: Initially the baby cannot understand that an object exists out of sight. It occurs around 7 months from birth.
    - The baby changes from a purely reflexive newbord to a thinking
2. Pre-operational Stage (2-6 years):
    - Toddler can understand the use of symbols and language, pretend plays (tea parties). **Symbolic Thinking** occurs.
    - **Preoperational Limitations**:
        - **Egocentrism**: Tendency to consider the world entirely in terms of one's own point of view. Preschoolers cannot "decenter". **See =>** _three mountains task_
        - **Confusing Apperance and Reality**: Tendency to focus exclusively on the most striking aspects of an object. _becoming frightened when someone puts on a mask_
3. Concrete Operational Stage (6-12 years):
    - Better at conservation tasks
    - Addition, substraction, multiplication
4. Formal Operational Stage (12-16 years)
    - Use logic without the presence of concrete manipulation

#### Evaluation of Piaget's Theory
- Children acquire the skills earlier than Piaget assumed
- Uneven performance: child may perform at a pre-operational level on most tasks, but at a concrete level at some other tasks

#### THEORY OF MIND
- Understanding that people have mental represantations of their own.
