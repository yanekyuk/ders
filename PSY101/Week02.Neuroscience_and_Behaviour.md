# Neuroscience and Behaviour

## Summary

- **Neurons** are the building blocks of the nervous system: They process information received from the outside world, communicate with one another, and send messages to the body's muscles and organs.
- Neurons are composed of three major parts:
  - **Cell body** contains the nucleus, which houses the organism's genetic material.
  - **Dendrites** receive sensory signals from other neurons and transmit this information to the cell body.
  - Each **axon** carries signals from the cell body to other neurons or to muscles and organs in the body.
- Neurons don't touch. They are seperated by a small gap, which is the part of the synapse across which signals are transmitted from one neuron to another.
- **Glial cells** provide support for neurons, usually in the form of the **myelin sheath**, which coats the axon to facilitate the transmission of information. In demyelinating diseases, the myelin sheats deteriorates.
- Neurons are differentiated according to the functions they perform. The three major types of neurons include **sensory neurons**_(e.g., bipolar neurons)_, **motor neurons**, and **interneurons**_(e.g., Purkinje cells)_.
- The conduction of an electric signal within a neuron happens when the resting potential is reversed by an electric impulse called an action potential.
- The neuron's resting potential is due the charge difference of elements inside and outside the membrane, which can allow potassium to flow outside while blocking sodiums from flowing in.
- If electric signals reach a threshold, this initiates action potential, an all-or-none signal that moves down the entire length of the axon. After the action potential has reached its maximum, a chemical pump reverses the imbalance in ions, returning the neuron to its resting potential. For a brief refractory period, the action potential cannot be re-initiated. Once it is initiated, the action potential spreads down the axon, jumping across the nodes of Ranvier to the synapse.
- Communication between neuros take place through synaptic transmission, where an action potential triggers release of neurotransmitters from the terminal buttons of the sending neuron's axon, which travel across the synapse to bind with receptors in the receiving neuron's dendrite.
- Neurotransmitters bind to dendrites on specific receptor sites. Neurotransmitters leave the synapse through reuptake, thorugh enzyme deactivation, and by binding to autoreceptors.
- Some of the major neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, dopanine, glutamate, GABA, norepnephire, serotonin, and endorphins.
- Drugs can affect behaviour by acting as agonists, or as antagonists. Recreational drug use can have an effect on brain function.
- Neurons make up nerves, which in turn form the human nervous system.
- The nervous system is divided into the peripheral and the central nervous systems. PNS connects the CNS with the rest of the body, and it is itself divided into somatic and autonomic nervous system.
- Somatic NS, which conveys information into and out of CNS, controls voluntary muscles, whereas autonomic NS automatically controls the body's organs.
- Autonomic NS is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic NS, Sympathetic NS prepares body for action in threatening situations, and parasympathetic NS returns it to its normal state.
- CNS is composed of the spinal cord and the brain. The spinal cord can control some basic behaviours such as spinal reflexes without any input from the brain *(e.g. pulling your hand from an hot stove)*.
- The brain can be divided into the **hindbrain**, **midbrain**, and **forebrain**.
- The hindbrain generally coordinates information coming into and out of the spinal cord with structures such as the **medulla**, the **reticular formation**, the **cerebellum**, and the **pons**. These structures respectively coordinate **breathing and heart rate**, **regulate sleep and arousal levels**, **coordinate fine motor skills**, and **communicate this information to the cortex**.
-The structures of the midbrain, the **tectum** and **tegmentum**, generally coordinates functions such as **orientation to the enviroment** and **movement and arousal toward sensory stimuli**.
- The forebrain generally coordinates higer-level functions, such as **perceiving**, **feeling**, and **thinking**. The forebrain houses **subcortical structures**, such as the **thalamus**, **hypothalamus**, **limbic system (including the hippocampus and amygdala)**, and **basal ganglia**; all these structures perform a variety of functions related to **motivation** and **emotion**. Also in the forebrain, the **cerebral cortex**, composed of two hemispheres with four lobes each (**occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal**), performs tasks that help make us fully human: **thinking**, **planning**, **judging**, **perceiving**, and **behaving purposefully and voluntarily**.
- Neurons in the brain can be shaped by experience and the enviroment, making the human brain amazingly plastic.
- Examining the development of the nervous system over the life span of an individual (its **ontogeny**) and across the time within which a species evolves (its **phylogeny**) presents further opportunities for understanding the human brain.
- The nervous system is the first system that forms in an embryo, starting as a neural tube, which forms the basis of the spinal cord. The neural tube expands on oone end to form the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain, each of which folds onto the next structure.
- Within each of these areas, specific brain structures begin to differentiate. The forebrain shows the greatest differentiation, and in particular, the cerebral cortex is the most developed in humans.
- Nervous systems evolved from simple collections of sensory and motor neurons in simple animals, such as flatworms, to elaborate centralized nervous systems found in mammals.
  - The evolution of the human nervous system can be thought of as a process of refining, elaborating, and expanding structures present in other species.
  - Reptiles and birds have almost no cerebral cortex. By contrast, mammals have a highly developed cerebral cortex.
  - The human brain appears to have evolved more quickly compared to other species to become adapted to a more complex enviroment.
- The gene, or the unit of hereditary transmission, is build from strands of DNA in a double-helix formation that is organized into chromosomes.
- Human have 23 pairs of chromosomes; half come from each parent.
  - A child shared 50% of his or her genes with each parent.
  - Monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes, whereas dizygotic twins share 50%, the same as any other siblings. Twins are often participants in genetic research.
- The study of genetics indicated that both genes and the enviroment work together to influence behavior. Genes set the range of variation in populations within a given enviroment, but they do not predict individual characteristics; experience and other enviromental factors play a crucial role as well.
- Epigenetics refers to enviromental influences that determie whether or not genes are expressed, without altering the basic DNA sequences that constitute the genes themselves. Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modification influence whether specific genes are switched on or off. Epigenetic influences have been shown to play a crucial role in persisting effects of early experiences in rats and humans.
- There are three major approaches to studying the link between the brain and behavior:
  - Observing how perceptual, motor, intellectual, and emotional capacities are affected following brain damage. By carefully relating specific psychological and behavioral disruptions to damage in particular areas of the brain, researchers can better understand how the area normally plays a role in producing those behaviors.
  - Examining global electrical activity in the brain and the patterns of single neurons. The patterns of electrical activity in large brain areas can be examined from outside the skull using the EEG. Single-cell recordings taken from specific neurons can be linked to specific perceptual or behavioral events, suggesting that those neurons represent particular kinds of stimuli or control particular aspects of behavior.
  - Using brain imaging to scan the brain as people perform different perceptual or intellectual tasks. Correlating energy comsumption in particular brain areas with specific cognitive and behavioral events suggest that those brain areas are involved in specific types of perceptual, motor, cognitive, or emotional processing.


## Q & A

- Which components of the neuron allow them to communicate?
  > Glial cells form myelin to help the axon carry information more efficiently.
- How do the three types of neurons work together to transmit information?
  > **Sensory neurons** receive information from external world and convey this information to the brain via the spinal cord. **Motor neurons** carry signals from the spinal cord to the muscles to produce movement. **Interneurons**, which connect sensory neurons, motor neurons, or other interneurons, carry information either from sensory neurons into the nervous system, or from the nervous system to motor neurons. Also, there are still others, performing a variety of information-processing functions within the nervous system.
- What difference between the inside and outside of the neuron's cell membrane creates the resting potential?
  > The charge difference between element particle's in neurons and their membranes inbetween. 
- Why is an action potential an all-or-nothing event?
  > Electric stimulation below the threshold fails to produce an action potential, whereas electric stimulation at or above the threshold always produces the action potential, whether stimuli is at or above the threshold.
- How does a neuron communicate with another neuron?
  > The action potential travels down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, wher eit stimulates the release of neurotransmtters from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitters float across the synapse and bind to receptor sites on a nearby dendrite of the receiving neuron, or _postsynaptic neuron_. A new action potential is initiated in that neuron, and the process continues down that neuron's axon to the next synapse and the next neuron. This electochemical action, called _synaptic transmission_, allow neurons to communicate with one another and ultimately underlies your thoughts, emotions, and behaviour.
- How do neurotransmitters create the feeling of runner's high?
  > As an individual push their body to painful limits of endurance, endorphins are released in the brain.
- How does L-dopa alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disesase?
  > Parkinson's disease is caused by the loss of neurons that use the neurotransmitter dopamine. Ingesting L-dopa will elevate the the amount of L-dopa in the brain and spur the surviving neurons to produce more dopamine. In other words, L-dopa acts as an agonist for dopamine. The use of L-dopa has been reasonably succesfull in the alleviation of Parkinson's disease symptoms.
- What triggers the increase in your heart rate when you feel threatened?
  > Sympathetic nervous system kicks into action, when feeling threatened, dilating one's pupils to let in more light, incresing one's heart rate and respiration to pump more oxygen to muscles, diverting blood flow to the brain and muscles, and activating sweat glands to cool the body.
- What important functions does the spinal cord perform on its own?
  > Spinal cord keeps one breathing, move one's muscles, allowing one to walk, without spinal cord brain would not be able to put any of its higher processing into action.
- Which part of the brain helps to orchestrate movements that keep you steady on your bike?
  > **Cerebellum** (latin for _little brain_) orchestrates the proper sequence of movements when we ride a bike, play the piano, or maintain balance while walking and running.
- How is the thalamus like a computer?
  > The thalamus acts as a kind of computer server in a networked system, taking in multiple inputs and relaying them to a variety of locations.
- Why are you likely to remember details of an traumatic event?
  > The amygdala attaches significance to previously neutral events that are associated with fear, punishment, or reward.
- Why is the part of the somatosensory cortex relating to the lips bigger than the area corresponding to the feet?
  > Each part of the somatosensory cortex maps onto a particular part of the body. If a body area is more sensitive, a larger part of the sometosensory cortex is devoted to it. **Because lips are more sensitive than feet.**
- What types of thinking occur in the frontal lobe?
  > **Abstract thinking, movement, planning, memory, and judgment.** The frontal cortex allows us to do the kind of thinking, imagining, planning, and anticipating that sets humans apart from most other species.
- What does it mean to say that the brain is plastic?
  > Functions that were assigned to certain areas of the brain may be capable of being reassigned to other areas of the brain to accomodate changing input from the enviroment. (i.e., after losing a finger)
- What are the stages of development of the embryonic brain?
  > It begins to develop within the 3rd week after fertilization. By the 4th week, the three basic levels of the brain are visible. During 5th week, the hindbrain and forebrain differentiate into subdivisions. During 7th week and later, the forebrain expands considerably to form the cerebral hemispheres.
- Are our brains still evolving?
  > Results from some researchs suggests so, becoming bigger and more adapted to the demands of the enviroment.
- Why do dizygotic twins share 50% of their genes, just like siblings born seperately?
  > Because they develop from two seperate fertilized egg. It's just like normal siblings, only difference is that they develop simultainously.
- Are abilities such as intelligence and memory, inherited through our genes?
  > Genetics is only half the story in intelligence, memory etc. Enviromental influences also play a significant role in predicting the basis of them.
- How have brain disorders been central to the study of specific areas of the brain?
  > Broca and Wernicke's descriptions of patiens who had their brain damaged in different areas (Broca's area, Wernicke's area) showed, respectively, language production and comprehension.
- What role does the corpus callosum play in behavior?
  > Non-existence of corpus callosum results in a split brain. Left and right hemisphere can't communicate with each. What's registered on either side, remains there.
- How does the EEG record electrical activity in the brain?
  > Typically, electronodes are placed on the outside of the head, and even though the source of electrical activity in synapses and action potentials is far removed from these wires, the electric signals can be amplified several thousand times by the EEG. This provides a visual record of the underlying electrical activity.
- What does an fMRI track in an active brain?
  > It detects the oxygenated hemoglobin and provides a picture of the level of activation in each brain area.
- Why should we avoid jumping to conclusions based on fMRI results?
  > Because, we don't yet know whether the results of laboratory fMRI studies of memory, which typically use simple materials like words or pictures, generalize to the kinds of complex everyday events. Furthermore, evidende that fMRI can distinguish accurate from inaccurate memories comes from studies in which brain activity is averaged across a group of participants, not from an individual.
