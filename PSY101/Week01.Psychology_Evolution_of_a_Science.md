# Psychology: Evolution of a Science

## Summary
- Philosophers debated ideas about human nature without empirical evidence.
- Earliest effort for scientific psychology came from **M.J.P. Flourens** and **Broca** via brain damage examination.
- **H. von Helmholtz** furthered the science via examining **reaction time**.
- **W. Wundt** is credited for **psychology as a scientific discipline**. Analyzed basic elements of consciousness via **structuralism**. His student **E. Titchener** brought structuralism to **USA**.
- **W. James** applied **Darwin's theory of natural selection** to the psychology. **Functionalism** focused on how mind adapts to its enviroments.
- **G.S. Hall** established first American research lab, journal and professional organization devoted to psychology.
- Psychologists often focused on patients with psychological disorders to understand behavior. **J.M Charcot** and **P. Janet** studied people who act differently under hypnosis. Raising the possibility of **multiple selves in one mind**.
- **S. Freud** developed **psychoanalysis** which emphasized **the unconscious** and **the childhood memories**.
- Humanistic psychologists offered a more **positive view of the human condition**. Suggesting **the possibility of full potential** with little help.
- **Behaviorism** advocated the study of **observable actions rather than the mental processes that could not be studied scientifically**. **I. Pavlov** and **J.B. Watson** emphasized the importance of enviroment shaping behavior.
- **B.F. Skinner** developed the concept of **reinforcement** which demostrates that animals and humans repeat **behavior that generate pleasant results**. He suggested that free will is an illusion and that reinforcement can be used to **benefit society**.
- **M. Wertheimer, F. Bartlett, J. Piaget** and **K. Lewin** defied the behaviorism and studied **inner workings of mind**. Their effors paved the way for **cognitive psychology** to focus on **inner mental processes** such as **perception, attention, memory** and **reasoning**.
- Cognitive Psychology developed as a field due to **the invention of the computer**, **the efforts to improve the performance of military**, and **N. Chomsky's theories about language**.
- **Cognitive Neuroscience** attempts to **link the brain with the mind** by studying individuals with or without brain damage using **brain scanning techniques**.
- **Evolutionary Psychology** focuses on **adaptive function that minds and brains serve to understand the nature of psychological processes** in terms of **natural selection**.
- **Social Psychology** recognizes individuals exist **as part of a grander network** and how they interact and influence with one another. It was pioneered by German emigrÃ© **K. Lewin**, motivated to **adress social issues and problems**.
- **Cultural Psychology** is concerned with **the effect of culture on individuals** and with **similarities and differences among people in different cultures**. In this context, **Absolutists** hold that culture has **little effect**, whereas **Relativists** **powerful effect** on most psychological phenomena.
- Social and Cultural Psychology together **expands psychology's horizons beyond examination of individuals.** They examine behavior within **the broader context of human interaction**.

## Q & A

- What fundamental question has puzzled philosophers for millennia? _pg. 6_
  > Nature vs. nurture question.
- What were the early explanations for dualism? _pg. 6_
  > Descartes' idea of the mind influences the body through a tiny structure near the bottom of the brain known as **pineal gland**. Hobbes' argument that the mind and body aren't different things at all; rather, the mind is what the brain _does_.
- How did work involving patients with brain damage help demonstrate the mind-brain connection? _pg. 7_
  > *Broca* and *Flourens*' works showed that with a damaged part of the brain the patient couldn't perform certain tasks.
- What was the useful application of Hermholtz's results? _pg. 8_
  > The usage reaction time to study the mind and the brain.
- How did the work of chemists influence early psychology? _pg. 8_
  > Chemists' tried to understand the structure of matter by breaking down natural substances into basic elements. So, *Wilhelm Wundt* adopted this approach to use it in psychology, which is called **structuralism**.
- What are the problems with the introspective method?
  > First of all, science requires replicable observations; introspective method only produces subjective output that is irreplicable.
- How does functionalism relate to Darwin's theory of natural selection? _pg. 11_
  > _William James_ was inspired by _Darwin_ and instead of **structuralism**, he adopted **functionalism**. Which is in line with Darwin's idea of natural selection. _Mental abilities must have evolved because they were adaptive, that is, because they helped people solve problems and increased their chances of survival._
- How was Freud influenced by work with hysteric patients? _pg. 13_
  > Work with hysteric patiens influenced Freud to theorize that many of the patients' problems could be traced to the effects of painful childhood expreriences that the person cound not remember, and he suggested that the powerful influence of these seemingly lost memories revealed the presence of an unconscious mind.
- Why are Freud's ideas less influential today? _pg. 15_
  > Two reasons:
  > - Incompatibility with **humanistic psychology**, Freud's ideas were dark.
  > - Freud's ideas were also difficult to test, and a theory that can't be tested is of limited use in psychology or other sciences.
- How did behaviorism help psychology advance as a science? _pg. 16_
  > _J.B. Watson_ believed that private experience was too idiosyncratic and vague to be an object of scientific inquiry. He advocated that psychology as a science should focus on the study of behavior--what people _do_, rather than what people _experience_--
- Which of Skinner's claims provoked an outcry? _pg. 19_
  > _Skinner Box_ is a **conditioning chamber** in which a rat is placed, when it accidentally push the button food drops into the chamber. He saw evidence for **principle of reinforcement**. His ideas of **reinforcement** had gone too far and he argued that reinforcement could be used to increase human well-being and solve social problems. This provoked an outcry because critics believe that Skinner was giving away the most cherished human quality, **the free will**.
- Why might people not see what an experimenter actually showed them? _pg. 21_
  > Because **Gestalt psychology**, in other words, the mind imposes organization on what it perceives, so people don't see what the experimenter actually shows them (two seperate lights);  instead, the see the elements as a unified whole (one moving light).
- How did the advent of computers change psychology? _pg. 22_
  > In two ways, first is the enormous practical impact; the second is the enormous **conceptual impact**. The similarities and differences between people and computers made people wonder whether the computer might be useful as a model for the human mind.
- What did psychologists learn from pilots during WWII? _pg. 23_
  > _Donald Broadbent_ learned that people are not able to attend to many different instruments at once and must actively move the focus of their attentions from one to another. There is a limit in the capacity to handle incoming information.
- What have we learned by watching the brain at work? _pg. 25_
  > The seperation of responsibilities on brain's left and right hemispheres, and by this, the usage of scanning techniques to observe people with various kinds of cognitive capacities and use their observations to unravel the mysteries of the mind and the brain.
- What evidence suggests that some traits can be inherited? _pg. 26_
  > Darwin's theory of evolution- Feathers in birds for body regulation and now flight.
- How did historical events influence the development of social psychology? _pg. 28_
  > The Holocaust- problems of conformity and obedience, civil Rights movement-stereotyping, prejudice, racism
- How did the anthropologists influence psychology in the 1980s? _pg. 29_
  > Until 80s and 90s, philosophers and anthropologists paid little attention to each other, but when they paid attention to each other, the rediscovered _Wundt_ as an intellectual ancestor of cultural psychology.
- Why are psychological conclusions so often relative to the person, place, or culture described? _pg. 29_
  > It seems likely that the most universal phenomena are those that are closely associated with the basic biology that all human beings share; conversely, the least universal phenomena are those rooted in the varied socialization practises that different cultures evolve.
- How has the face of psychology changed as the field has evolved? _pg. 32_
  > There has been a major shift from men to women. At the first meeting of APA, there were neither women nor non-white person. Today, it is prominently women and the first member of a minority group to become president of APA was Kenneth Clark in 1970.
