# Methods in Psychology

## Summary

##### Empiricism: How to know stuff
  - It is the belief that the best way to understand the world is to observe it firsthand. Only in the last few centuries, it has come to prominence.
  - It is at the heart of every scientific method, because we need falsiable hypotheses and observation to prove them wrong, but not true.
  - Observation doesn't just mean "looking". It requires a method. The methods of psychology are special because, more than most other natural phenomena, human beings are complex, variable, and reactive.
##### Observation: Discovering what people do
  - Measurement involves defining a property in terms of a concrete condition, and then constructing a measure that can detect that condition. A good measure is valid (the concrete conditions it measures are conceptually related to the property of interest), is reliable (it produces that same measurement whenever it is used to measure the same thing), and is powerful (it can detect the concrete conditions when they actually exist).
  - When people know they are being observed, they may behave as they think they should. Demand characteristics are features of a setting that suggests to people that they should behave in a particular way. Psychologists try to reduce or eliminate demand characteristics by observing participants in their natural habitats or by hiding their expectations from the the participant. Observer bias is the tendency for observers to see what they expect to see or cause others to behave as they expect them to behave. Psychologists try to eliminate observer bias by making double-blind observations.
  - Psychologists often describe the measurements they make with a graphic representation called a frequency distribution, which often has a special shape known as the normal distribution. They also describe their measurements with descriptive statistics; the most common are descriptions of central tendency (such as the mean, median and mode) and descriptions of variability (such as the range and the standart deviation).
##### Explanation: Discovering why people do what they do
  - To determine whether two variables are causally related, we must first determine whether they are related at all. This can be done by measuring each variable many times and then comparing the patterns of variation within each series of measurements. If the patterns covary, then the variables are correlated. Correlations allow us to predict the value of one variable from knowledge of the value of the other. The direction and strength of a correlation are measured by the correlation coefficient (_r_).
  -  Even when we observe a correlation between two variables, we can’t conclude that they are causally related because there are an infinite number of third variables that might be causing them both. Experiments solve this third-variable problem by manipulating an independent variable, randomly assigning participants to the experimental and control groups that this manipulation creates, and measuring a dependent variable. These measurements are then compared across groups. If inferential statistics show that if random assignment failed, then the results would only happen 5% of the time, then differences in the measurements across groups are assumed to have been caused by the manipulation.
  - An internally valid experiment establishes a causal relationship between variables as they were operationally defined and among the participants whom they included. When an experiment mimics the real world, it is externally valid. But most psychology experiments are not attempts to mimic the real world, but to test hypotheses derived from theories.
  - Thinking critically about evidence is difficult because people have a natural tendency to see what they expect to see, to see what they want to see, and to consider what they see but not what they don’t.
##### The Ethics of Science: First, Do No Harm
  - Instutional review boards ensure that the rights of human beings who participate in scientific research are based on the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.
  - Psychologists are obligated to uphold these principles by getting informed consent from participants, not coercing participation, protecting participants from harm, weighing benefits against risks, avoiding deception, and keeping information confidential.
  - Psychologists are obligated to respect the rights of animals and treat them humanely. Most people are in favor of using animals in scientific research.
  - Psychologists are obligated to tell the truth about their studies, to share credit appropriately, and to grant others access to their data.

## Q & A
##### Empicism
- What is the scientific method?
  > The scientific method is usually following the simplest theory that explains all the evidence, and only if that is not enough, continuing with more complicated ones.
- Why can theories be proven wrong but not right?
  > Because there is a limit to the observation that humankind can make. We can't make universal claims without knowing every single thing in the universe in all times.
- What makes human beings especially difficult to study?
  > 1. Complexity: The human brain is the most complex thing that we know of so far. 
  > 2. Variability: Humans varies too much from each other. 
  > 3. Reactivity: A single person behave differently in different conditions.

##### Observation
- What two things does measurement require?
  > **Define** the property we wish to measure and then find a way to **detect** it.
- What are the properties of a good operational definition and a good instrument?
  > THe most important for a good opeartional definition is **validity**, the goodness with which a concrete event defines a property. For example, the contcrete event called _frequency of smiling_ iis a valid way to define the property called _happiness_ because, as we all know, people tend to smile more often when they feel happy. For the good instrument, it is **reliability** and **power**.
- How do people respond when they know they're being observed? 
  > They act according to how they think they should act.
- Why is it important for subjects to be "blind"?
  > When people are "blind" to the purpose of an observation, they can't behave the way they think they should behave because they don't know how they should behave.
- Why it is important for experimenters to be "blind"?
  > Because expectations can influence observations and reality.
- What is a frequency distribution? 
  > A graphical representation of measurements arranged by the number of times each measurement was made.
- What are the two major kinds of descriptive statistics?
  > The **central tendency** of and **variability** in a frequency distribution.
- What are two measures of variability?
  > **Range** and **standart deviation**.

##### Explanation
- How can we tell if two variables are correlated?
  > First we measure a pair of variables, then we repeat and make this a series of measurements, and finally we try to discern a pattern in our series of measurements.
- How can correlations be measured?
  > With **correlation coefficient**, in which it is also measured for its **strength** and **direction**. 
- What does it mean for a correlation to be strong?
  > The strength of a correlation tells us about the number of expections and hence about how confident we can be when using the correlation to make predictions.
- What is third-variable correlation?
  > Two variables are correlated only because each is causally related to a third variable.
- What's the difference between matched samples and matched pairs?
  > In the former, participants in each group are identical in terms of a third variable; in the latter, each participant is identical to **one other participant** from the other group.
- What are the two main features of an experiment?
  > Manipulation and random assignment.
- What are the three main steps in doing an experiment?
  > First, we perform a manipulation. Then, having manipulated one variable, we now measure another variable. Finally, we look to see whether our manipulation of the independent variable produced changes in the dependent variable.
- Why can't we allow people to select the condition of the experiment in which they will participate?
  > It doesn't serve the goal of an experiment. If people were allowed to select their own group, there would be countless variables that divides them, and there would be no way to measure any correlation.
- Why is random assignment so useful and important?
  > That is the best way we could come up with so far. Otherwise, there would be a third variable. (nature, subject, experimenter etc.)
- Why isn't external validity necessary?
  > The results of any experiment depend on how the independent and dependent variables are defined. Those defined variables' comparison is the main result.  
- What is the difference between a population and a sample?
  > A population is a complete collection of people, whereas a sample is a partial collection of people drawn from a population.
- If random sampling is good, why isn't it necessary?
  > It is difficult to have random sampling because almost all experiments involve voluntary people to observe.
- Why is nonrandom sampling a nonfatal flaw?
  > There are three reasons why:
  > 
  > 1. Sometimes the similarity of a sample and a population doesn't matter. It can still be illuminating. 
  > 2. When the ability to generalize an experimental result is important, psychologists perform new experiments that use the same procedures but on different samples. If the result replicate, then we would be more confident about them. If not, then we would learn something about the influences of culture, age or ability etc.
  > 3. Sometimes the similarity of the sample and the population is simply a reasonable starting assumption. 
- How do our beliefs and desires shape the way we think about evidence?
  > Just so...
- Why is it important to consider unseen evidence?
  > Because our tendency to ignore missing evidence can cause us to draw all kinds of erroneous conclusions.
##### Ethics of Science
- What are three features of ethical research?
  > Respect for persons and their right to make decisions, beneficency of the research, and justness of research.
- What steps must psychologists take to protect nonhuman subjects?
  > Research must be supervised by psychologists who are experienced in the care of laboratory animals and who are responsible for ensuring their comfort, health and humane treatment. Reasonable effort to minimize the discomfort, infection, illness and pain. Only if there is no alternative, a procedure involving pain, stress, or privation. All surgical procedures must be performed under appropriate anesthesia.
- What are psychologists expected to do when they report the results of their research?
  > Report truthfully, share credit fairly, share their data.
