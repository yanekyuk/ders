#### Kew Gardens, Virginia Woolf

##### Plot

The story opens with the description of a flowerbed in a garden, detailing the colors and shaped of flowers. Throughout the story, we listen to pedestrians' conversation until they are abruptly leave the focus. First, a family walks through the scene in which we read a conversation between the husband and the wife, only to realize then it is actually the mind of the father. He contemplates on his past, then he contemplates on his conversation with his wife on his past. Then, narrative turns to a snail, snailing in the flowerbed, trying to get past the obstacles. Next, an older man and a young man comes into focus of whom the conversation is kind of irrational and mad. The focus of narrative then again changes to another set of people who are two lower middle-class women whose attention caught the eccentricity of the old man. Arguing over what the old man is saying, one of them gazes at the flowers and realize that it is tea time. We go back to the snail, who is about to get past "the high brown roof" of the leaf, two other figures approach and they seem to be in love. They stick an umbrella into the soil and wander off to have some tea. The narrative ends the scene with yet another description of the scene.

##### Theme

Criticizing the progress

Harmony in the order of things

Banality of everyday life

#### That Evening Sun, William Faulkner

##### In Class

Written in 1931 with Southern Gothic style which is a very atmospheric and dark one. Its setting is American South (after civil war) which has always been associated with slavery. A very good example of Southern Gothic is _A Rose for Emily_. Style's characteristics are being grotesque, violent, or just having potential of violence. A dominant aspect of Gothic stories is nature as being a sinister power.

> American south got rich through slavery. After it was banned, the losing side (south) lost its economical power alongside gaining feeling of loss, dissatisfaction, and disillusionment. 

The story is clearly subjective, due to the narration being a memory of the protagonist, distorting the reality.

Modernism is Faulkner:

 - Interruption of linear temporality
 - Disjointed / fragmented flow of events
 - Jumps in the narrative
 - Non-filtered conversations happening in disturbing levels
 - focus on psychological realism
 - open ended, open to interpretation
 - double distance to reality about Nancy

##### Plot

Protagonists remembers 15 years ago, his childhood, in the town named Jefferson, especially the family servant Nancy, a black prostitute for white men who did his family's laundry. Nancy had a husband named Jesus who one day threatened to cut a white man's penis because he suspected that the white man was responsible for his wife's pregnancy. Protagonist, Quentin, then remembers a particular day when Nancy was too afraid to walk her home due to her fear of Jesus. Family escorts her to home everyday until the mother of the family complains about it. The day they stopped escorting her, Nancy began to be in horror, acting madly, detached from reality. The father, armed, checks for Jesus but can not find him anywhere. Around here, Nancy declares that **she is hell-born, doomed to death** to children. She wants to stay the night in children's room but the mother rejects, then she takes the children to her house thinking that their presence would protect her. There she tries to entertain them by telling stories and offering popcorn, but the children act restless and, Jason especially, want to go home. In the meantime, Nancy acts a bit strange, for instance she puts her hands on hot lamp, chimney and even fire without feeling pain. Then they hear voices of someone coming, but in the next chapter we find out that that someone is the father, upon arrival, tells Nancy to go stay somewhere else, takes the children and go away. While leaving Quentin asks his father "Who will do our washing now, Father?"

##### Theme

- Point of View:
  - PoV distorts reality. Author makes sure that we understand it.

- Racial Conflict: 
  - Prejudice against black people is filtered through children's perspective.
  - In the town where the story is set racism is very pervasive. It is mainly looked through children's point of view (plot-oriented), not the moral about it directly. Quentin remembers the events that is connected to racism, but he doesn't state his opinions on it.
- Madness:
- Memory:

#### Impressionism

An artistic movement emerged in France in 19th century.

> One doesn't paint a landscape or a figure, one paints an impression.
>
> Monet enough :D

_Le Chemin de Fer_,

_Un Bar aux Folies-Bérgere_ depicts a bar distorted in the mirror. Definitely not realistic, it's experimental. Figure is centralized and very detached and looking directly to us, challenging our limits, boundaries. An impossible reality.

#### Post-Impressionism

_The Card Players (1890-95)_ depicts scenes in a way that is limited. There is no holisticity. The posture of the figures seem grotesque. They're bigger than one would expect. There is inconsistency in both space and figures. The space is not homogeneus. The reality is what we see rather the this objective truth existing out of our point of view.

_The Basket of apples (1895)_ requires two different perspectives. Experimentation of form, the unity of space, and the point of view (perspective) which can distort reality.

#### Muscle Memory, Karlin

##### In Class

**Setting**: The story takes place in post-Katrina New Orleans. New Orleans never mentioned, but it canbe deduced by the facts that the place is by the sea and it is in under risk of flood. The place is clearly an industrial setting, consisting of the French, the Mexican, and the American. Smells are used to portray the city as rotten, depopulated.

In the end, protagonist overcomes her past, just like in a fairytale. Industry is portrayed epicly.

Protagonist's journey of learning how to weld. 

##### Plot

##### Theme

> Trauma, music, healing, survival, reconstruction.

- The story demostrates how one copes with disaster by picking up a personal goal and by appreciating a lost culture.
- The story celebrates the importance of ambition and perserverence regardless of trying circumstances.

##### In Class

- Gothic stories are the predecessors of horror stories
- Usually identified as *supernatural horror*. 
- Gothic stories usually takes place in remote, isolated setting such as haunted castles or ruins. Usually with a hostile enviroment. A good example would be *Dracula* in which an Englishman goes to Carpatian Mountains in Romania that is an unfamiliar setting for the protagonist.
- In Gothic, what is taboo, repressed is expressed. (sexuality, perversion, as id or libido in Freud's terms)
- The House is personified (sentient). Fear is contagious?
- Characteristics of the story are:
  - Increasing tension
  - Fainting, excess, gloom, sorrow, bleak, ghastly, ghostly, pale, nervous, sullen, stuppor, passion, melancholy, solemn, morbid, terror...
  - Extreme weather conditions
  - Secret past - ancestral sin (incestuous house)
  - Lack of clarity (location, time period are all unknown)
  - Imprisonment, oppression, and claustrophobia.
  - Having no control is frightening.
  - Doppelganger? (Russian as best example)
- The house is more detailed (maybe more human) that the sister Madelein. 

##### Plot

#### Detective Fiction

- It doesn't focus on psychology of characters in a Chekhovskian sense.
- It makes use of:
  - **Stock characterization** (naive character, dubious characters, etc.)
  - Sidekick / Narrator *i.e. Dr. Watson*

- First detective story was written by Poe.

#### A Scandal in Bohemia, Arthur Conan Doyle

- Written in 1891, just after Jack the Ripper murders. Jack killed sex workers, and the police couldn't catch him. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional solution to this disturbance of notbeing able to arrest a serial killer.
- Sherlock is an enigma, too eccentiric for reader to relate to.
  - He has an aristoctratic background.
  - He is open to irrationality, fantasy, magic
  - He is doing this for recreative purposes.
  - He is combining rationality with irrationality in a positive manner accompanied by a holistic view.
  - He depends on ratiocation and his methodology.
- Dr. Watson is a middle-class decent man just like the potential readers
  - He is like a pseudo-reader.
  - He is very goal oriented, rational, and determined.
  - He acts as a **foil** to Holmes.
  - He is the **volarization of the detective**.
- In Victorian era, serialization was very popular. People would go to work and in the train an easy-to-understand short story is a good read.
- In American Detective stories, the detective always carry a gun because what they are fighting are much more serious. In Sherlock Holmes, this isn't the case. 
  - Also American detectives are always lonely, just as lonely cowboys.
- The stories of Sherlock Holmes served as a soothing for the people. People was made to think that it was possible to solve the crimes through Holmes, reasoning, or trying harder.

#### Magical Realism

- All these stories are **antirealist**, have **post-modernist tendencies**, and is an example of **magical realism**.

- ```
  Ordinary + Extraordinary Life Details
  Rational + Irrational
  ```

- There is no hierarchy between magical and real. They are equal in the amount of attention given to them.

- The existence of fantasy elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism.

- Questioning and challenging reality and the absolute truths that are taken for granted.

- It can be thought as a political statement. Western reality doesn't represent other's reality. Instead, making fun of it appeals to people. Having to live with irrationality all the time causes this.

- Realism was a western movement, anti-realism emerged in South America.

- Childlike perspective is very usual in this style.

- [Metafiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction)

  - Author appears in the text

#### Light is Like Water, Gabriel Garcia Marquez

- Marquez is Columbian and writes in Spanish.
- The family in the story is Columbian and they are nostalgic. Buying a rowboat in Madrid doesn't make sense but for nostalgia.
- The things they are used to in Columbia don't appear in Madrid.

#### The Rememberer,  Aimee Bender

- Bender is American, writes in English.
- She keeps going to work, meanwhile extraordinary things are going on. This is an example of rational and irrational existing in the same time.

#### The Aquatic Uncle, Italo Calvino

- Calvino is and writes in Italian.

---

#### Science-Fiction

- Soft / Hard Sci-fi, former can be speculative. Latter usually not. ???
- Sci-fi was underrated in academia until recently. 
- Frankenstein is considered to be early science-fiction. (resurrection through science and technology)
- Science-fiction allows us to see our reality in a different perspective.
- **Novum** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for *new thing*) is a term used by sci-fi authors to describe the scientifically plausible innovations used by [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) narratives.
- In sci-fi the elements can be creative and/or threatening.
  - **Science / Technology**: Science is used as a reference point in a consistent way. Opposing to the magical realism where consistency is non-existant.
  - **Displacement**: Sci-fi has to exist in a different environment to ours. It can be our environment modified, or a completely another planet etc. It can be in space, in a diffrerent time, in a different social condition, or to an alien being. But it doesn't have to be all of it. **A familiar theme helps us to be immersed in the unfamiliar** which is realatable to magical realism as well.
  - **Estrangement**: Sci-fi moves the reader to a deep way of thinking about the text through alienation. Brecht used methods that are alienating the reader, enabling them to bu suspicious of the realities of the situations they face in life.

#### Stereotypes

- In **Reunion** by **John Cheever**, the protagonist's father shows stereotypical behavior of an alcoholic or a masculine figure. But the story itself doesn't focus on these characteristics.
- In **The Necklace** by **Guy de Maupassant**, Mathilde is a stereotype who values material belongings a bit too much. She treats her husband badly because of this characterization. In the end, because she had lost the necklace, her and her husband's life was ruined for nothing. That's because the necklace wasn't even genuinely precious. She only though so.
- In **The Lady with the Dog** by **Anton Chekhov**, although the protagonist was presented as a stereotype such as a womanizer, as the story progresses, we realize that it isn't that simple. As the situation between Anna and Gurov gets more complex, we are presented that nothing is stereotypical and they are more closer to being genuine people than being caricatures.
- In **That Evening Sun** by **William Faulkner**, stereotypicality is in the eyes of the characters in the story rather than being in author's or reader's perspective. 
- In **The Fall of House Usher** by **Edgar Allan Poe**, the setting and the characters are a bit stereotypical because of preferences that make a story **Gothic**. Gothic stories usually take place in remote, isolated settings, and that is what Poe exactly does.
- In **A Scandal in Bohemia** by **Arthur Conan Doyle**, the characters are also stereotypical in terms of function. Because Sherlock himself is too eccentric to be understood, author makes use of Dr. Watson who is very similar to the readers of that time as a **pseudo-reader** and a **foil** to Sherlock Holmes.

#### Morality

- In **Reunion** by **John Cheever**, the story has an underlying moral which is not forced. Basically the protagonist expects to bond with his father after all that time but he is ultimately so disappointed that he leaves even without saying goodbye. This disappointment occurs from the actions of the father who tries to act like a father but fails miserably repeatedly and who is unable to learn from experience.
- In **The Necklace** by **Guy de Maupassant**, morals are presented obviously by the fact that Mathilde being too materialistic being punished for it for nothing but her own illusionment.

Her friend agrees to lend one but she convinces her to give her a more expensive looking one. At party night she was praised by everyone at the party, and when its time for leaving, she descends the stairs fast. When they get in to the taxi, she realizes that she has lost the necklace. Next day they try to replace the necklace with the same one or imitated one with no success. They find a new one but its too expensive. Nevertheless, they buy the necklace with borrowed money and their savings. After 10 years of misery, she bumps into her friend in the street, and, when her friend asks what happened to her, she explains the whole story, and, her old friend, in turn, explains that it was a fake necklace and you shouldn't have to do all of that.
- In **The Lady with the Pet Dog** by **Anton Chekhov**, the banker Dmitry Dmitrich Gurov, a married but philandering man of almost forty, spends a vacation alone in the seaside resort of Yalta, where he meets and skillfully seduces a much younger lady, Anna Sergeyevna, who is also on holiday without her spouse. Their first encounter leads to a furtive and sporadic liaison, with Anna, who lives in a provincial town, having trysts with him in Moscow once every two or three months. Now deeply in love, the couple faces an unpredictable future. Chekhov ends the story on this indeterminate note.
- In **Kew Gardens** by **Virginia Woolf**, the story opens with the description of a flowerbed in a garden, detailing the colors and shaped of flowers. Throughout the story, we listen to pedestrians' conversation until they are abruptly leave the focus. First, a family walks through the scene in which we read a conversation between the husband and the wife, only to realize then it is actually the mind of the father. He contemplates on his past, then he contemplates on his conversation with his wife on his past. Then, narrative turns to a snail, snailing in the flowerbed, trying to get past the obstacles. Next, an older man and a young man comes into focus of whom the conversation is kind of irrational and mad. The focus of narrative then again changes to another set of people who are two lower middle-class women whose attention caught the eccentricity of the old man. Arguing over what the old man is saying, one of them gazes at the flowers and realize that it is tea time. We go back to the snail, who is about to get past "the high brown roof" of the leaf, two other figures approach and they seem to be in love. They stick an umbrella into the soil and wander off to have some tea. The narrative ends the scene with yet another description of the scene.
- In **That Evening Sun** by **William Faulkner**, the protagonist remembers 15 years ago, his childhood, in the town named Jefferson, especially the family servant Nancy, a black prostitute for white men who did his family's laundry. Nancy had a husband named Jesus who one day threatened to cut a white man's vine (penis?) because he suspected that the white man was responsible for his wife's pregnancy. Protagonist, Quentin, then remembers a particular day when Nancy was too afraid to walk her home due to her fear of Jesus. Family escorts her to home everyday until the mother of the family complains about it. The day they stopped escorting her, Nancy began to be in horror, acting madly, detached from reality. The father, armed, checks for Jesus but can not find him anywhere. Around here, Nancy declares that **she is hell-born, doomed to death** to children. She wants to stay the night in children's room but the mother rejects, then she takes the children to her house thinking that their presence would protect her. There she tries to entertain them by telling stories and offering popcorn, but the children act restless and, Jason especially, want to go home. In the meantime, Nancy acts a bit strange, for instance she puts her hands on hot lamp, chimney and even fire without feeling pain. Then they hear voices of someone coming, but in the next chapter we find out that that someone is the father, upon arrival, tells Nancy to go stay somewhere else, takes the children and go away. While leaving Quentin asks his father "Who will do our washing now, Father?"
- In **Muscle Memory** by **Katherine Karlin**, the story takes place in post-Katrina New Orleans. Our protagonist, Destiny, after this tragedy, tries to get in control of her life by becoming a welder. She, through difficulties, convinces a welder who is also an ex-famous musician to teach her until she is good enough to consider herself a master. Throughout the story; the welder teacher her the music culture of NO, her mother calms her when she thinks that she will not be able to master welding. In the end, with the help of muscle memory, she manages to master welding and gets a certificate. Along with the music culture of NO.
- In **The Fall of House Usher** by **Edgar Allan Poe**, An unnamed narrator arrives at the House of Usher, a very creepy mansion owned by his boyhood friend Roderick Usher. Roderick has been sick lately, afflicted by a disease of the mind, and wrote to his friend, our narrator, asking for help. The narrator spends some time admiring the awesomely spooky Usher edifice. While doing so, he explains that Roderick and his sister are the last of the Usher bloodline, and that the family is famous for its dedication to the arts (music, painting, literature, etc.). Eventually, the narrator heads inside to see his friend. Roderick indeed appears to be a sick man. He suffers from an "acuteness of the senses," or hyper-sensitivity to light, sound, taste, and tactile sensations; he feels that he will die of the fear he feels. He attributes part of his illness to the fact that his sister, Madeline, suffers from catalepsy (a sickness involving seizures) and will soon die, and part of it to the belief that his creepy house is sentient (able to perceive things) and has a great power over him. He hasn't left the mansion in years. The narrator tries to help him get his mind off all this death and gloom by poring over the literature, music, and art that Roderick so loves. It doesn't seem to help. As Roderick predicted, Madeline soon dies. At least we think so. All we know is that Roderick tells the narrator she’s dead, and that she appears to be dead when he looks at her. Of course, because of her catalepsy, she might just *look like* she’s dead, post-seizure. Keep that in mind. At Roderick’s request, the narrator helps him to entomb her body in one of the vaults underneath the mansion. While they do so, the narrator discovers that the two of them were twins and that they shared some sort of supernatural, probably extrasensory, bond. About a week later, on a dark and stormy night, the narrator and Usher find themselves unable to sleep. They decide to pass away the scary night by reading a book. As the narrator reads the text aloud, all the sounds from the fictional story can be heard resounding from below the mansion. It doesn't take long for Usher to freak out; he jumps up and declares that they buried Madeline alive and that now she is coming back. Sure enough, the doors blow open and there stands a trembling, bloody Madeline. She throws herself at Usher, who falls to the floor and, after "violent" agony, dies along with his sister. The narrator flees; outside he watches the House of Usher crack in two and sink into the dark, dank pool that lies before it.
- In **A Scandal in Bohemia** by **Arthur Conan Doyle**, “A Scandal in Bohemia” is the first short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring his now iconic character Sherlock Holmes. It was published in 1891 and is also well known for introducing the character of Irene Adler, a woman who becomes a romantic interest for Holmes in later works. The story begins with a married Watson paying Holmes a visit. While Watson is there, a masked  visitor enters the room claiming to be Count Kramm, an agent for a wealthy client who does not wish to reveal himself. Holmes quickly identifies the masked man as Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and the hereditary King of Bohemia. The man admits that Holmes is correct and removes the mask. The king is engaged to a Scandinavian princess, but he is worried about his previous liaison with the American opera singer Irene Adler. During that liaison, he had written letters to Irene and had a picture of the two of them made; now the king is worried about his fiancee’s strict family and wants to have the letters and picture back. The problem is that Irene refuses to return either, and the king requests that Holmes locate the photograph. He has already tried to retrieve it himself, sometimes through forceful means, and his offer to pay for it was also refused. Irene is now threatening to send it to his fiancee’s family, so the king is desperate for help. The photograph is too bulky to be carried on Irene’s person. Holmes surmises that she must have it hidden close to her. Holmes receives money for expenses from the king, and asks Watson to meet him at his home the next day. The next morning, Watson visits Irene’s apartment disguised as a drunken, out of work groom. Some of the stablemen inform him that she has a frequent gentleman caller, the barrister Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. Norton visits her on this particular day, and then he takes a cab to a church. A little while later Irene leaves, heading to the same place. Holmes follows and then accidentally becomes the witness to their marriage. They all go their separate ways after the small ceremony. Watson has been waiting for Holmes to arrive back at his apartment. Sherlock is amused by the earlier events and fills Watson in on them when he arrives. Watson agrees to be part of a plan to discover where Irene has hidden the picture. Watson dresses as a clergyman, and he and Watson head back to Irene’s apartment. A group of men is standing on the street, and when she arrives, they fight over who will get to help her. Holmes rushes over to protect her and seems to be hurt in the scuffle. Irene takes him into her apartment, where he is laid on the couch to recover. At a prearranged signal, Watson tosses a smoke rocket into the apartment and shouts “fire!” Holmes tells Watson later that he saw Irene rush to her most prized possession, the photograph, when she thought the building might be destroyed. Holmes now knows its hiding place. He tells Watson that he was unable to take it at that moment because he was being watched, but that he will return later. At that moment, the two men are bid goodnight by a familiar-sounding youth, who slips away in the crowd. Holmes tells the king of his findings, but when he goes to retrieve the photograph, Irene’s elderly maidservant tells them that Irene has left hastily for the train station. Instead of the photograph of her and the king, Holmes finds only a photograph of her in an evening dress, and a letter addressed to him. In the letter, she explains that she was the youth from the previous night, and congratulates him on doing such a good job fooling her with his disguises and locating the photograph. She has left with Norton, however, who is an honorable man. She will not give the photograph to the king’s fiancee’s family and wishes only to keep it to prevent further action against her by the king. The king is impressed with this result and asks Holmes how he wishes to be paid. Holmes takes only the photograph of Irene, telling the king, as the king laments what a wonderful woman Irene is, that they are not of the same station. He insinuates that her station is far higher than the king’s, but Holmes’ subtlety  is lost on the king. Watson has already referred to Irene as “the late Irene Adler,” alluding to her death in the intervening three years between the events described in the short story, and the moment at which they are recounted. Holmes, however, refers to her honorably from then on as “the woman.” As with all Holmes stories, observation is at the forefront of the story. Holmes is able not only to see, but to really observe. This talent is normally lost on the rest of the characters in the story. In this particular story, however, he is matched and bested by the observational skills of Irene. One of the major themes of the story is the battle between wit and force. The two major male players in the game of subterfuge use force to try to retrieve the photograph. They are bested by Irene’s use of her wit and clever disguises. Ultimately, wit wins.
- In **Light is Like Water** by **Gabriel Garcia Marquez**, we are told of a story of a migrant family who were from Columbia and now are in Madrid. The story starts with two siblings asking for a boat for Christmas. Their parents agree because they promised if the are successful enough they will buy it. At some point, the narrator says to the children that "light is like water" and, in turn, through the children's imagination / reality, builds the grounds for light being literally like water. Every Wednesday night, when their parent are not home, children sail the boat in light. In time, they are rewarded with all kinds of diving equipment using their "success" in school. In the final, because they've become honorary students, this time, their parents ask what they want and they state, since they have everything the required, for a party with their friends in their home. But this party goes out of hand with all the imagination that children provide and the light becomes a golden flood. Finally, the author jokingly states that since the people of Madrid, having never mastered the science of navigating on light, there was no solution.
- In **The Rememberer** by **Aimee Bender**, we are told of a story of a woman whose boyfriend evolves backward. As the narrative progresses, Annie reminisces on the last days Ben was human. Ben was an intelligent and somber man, one of the reasons Annie fell in love with him as she said "We'd sit together and be sad and think about being sad and sometimes discuss sadness." She recalls that Ben had once told her that they think too much and unknowingly leave emotion aside. "We're all getting too smart. Our brains are just getting bigger and bigger, and the world dries up and dies when there's too much thought and not enough heart." On his last night of human, Annie and Ben make love, and Annie reassures him by whispering into his ear, "see, we're not thinking...we're not thinking at all." Annie wakes up next morning, discovering that Ben has shifted to an ape . As a caring and loving woman Annie takes the time to care for ape Ben. After Ben has turned into a sea turtle, Annie returns from work one day and discovers that he has again shifted, now into a salamander in the baking pan. Realizing she cannot take any more of this, Annie decides to let Ben go. She releases Ben the salamander into the ocean, hoping that one day Ben will rise from the shore, as the man "who has been to history and back." In the end, she must wait and remember, as she says, "it is my job to remember."
- In **The Aquatic Uncle** by **Italo Calvano**, a tale is told, on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land. The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle, N'ba N'ga, who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like "civilized" people. The protagonist, Qfwfq, falls in love with Lll whose family had become established on Earth in the earliest period and become convinced that they had never lived anywhere else. One day, Qfwfq ashamedly introduces Lll to his uncle but, contrary to his expectations, Lll is quite interested in his uncle. Apparently, she doesn't have any prejudices against living in the sea because she was never in a position that required being told to think otherwise. Eventually, she dumps the protagonist and escapes to his uncle.
- In **All Summer in a Day** by **Ray Bradbury**,  a story about a group of school children living on Venus is told. Venus only experiences rain, but once every seven years, the sun comes out for two hours. It is an occasion to celebrate because it is so rare, and the small children have not experienced it yet in their young lives. However, a girl by the name of Margot moved to Venus from Earth. She has lived in an environment when the sun shines all the time. The children don’t believe her stories about the sun and what it looks like, so they lock her in a closet. When the sun does come out, the children celebrate it outdoors until it starts raining again. When they go back inside, they realize they have left Margot in the closet. They are ashamed of themselves and regret their actions. For Margot, she will have to wait another seven years to see the sun she loves and misses so much. 
- In **Half a Day** by **Naguip Mahrouz**, the story opens, the narrator is a young boy walking to his first day of school. The boy is delighted with the new clothes he is wearing for the occasion, but is apprehensive about going to school. As he walks along, holding onto his father’s hand, he occasionally turns to ask his father why he must go; he feels that perhaps he is being sent away from home as a punishment. Although his father reassures him, he is not convinced that “there really was any good to be had in tearing me away from the intimacy of my home.” At the gate to the school, the boy hesitates again, and must be gently pushed by his father to enter the schoolyard. Telling him to “be a man,” the father explains that “today you truly begin life.” Upon stepping into the yard, the boy sees the faces of the other boys and girls, but feels “like a stranger who had lost his way.” One boy approaches and asks the narrator who brought him to school; when he replies that it was his father, the other boy states that his own father is dead. The narrator soon becomes one of the group of children, and the narrative voice changes from the first person singular “I” to alternatively speaking in the third person plural “we.” The narrator makes friends with some of the boys and falls in love with some of the girls. He describes the school day in a manner which is meant to be interpreted as an allegory for human life, with its ups and downs, trials and tribulations. When the bell rings to announce the end of the day, the narrator steps outside the gate, but his father is not waiting there for him as promised. He encounters a familiar middle-aged man; they greet one another and shake hands before the man moves along. The narrator finds that the street and surroundings have completely changed since the morning. These changes are meant to be understood in allegorical terms, as representing the effect of modernization and urbanization in radically changing the face of the city within the lifetime of one man. He is unable to cross the street because of heavy traffic. Finally, a “young lad” offers to help him across, addressing him as “Grandpa”—the little boy has passed an entire life time in what seemed like only half a day, and is now an old man at the end of his life.
- In **The Ones Who Walk Away from the Omelas** by **Ursula K. LeGuin**, Omelas is a utopian city where the people lead lives that are happy, in the best sense of the word. On the day on which the narrator is focusing, the city’s people are celebrating the summer festival. The children ride willing horses in races and race about the fields in their bare feet. The day is bright and clear, music of all kinds fills the air, bells ring, and the air itself is sweet. The narrator is conscious of the fact that the idea of happiness, and in particular the happiness of an entire city, may be a suspect concept to others. Happiness implies a kind of innocence and foolishness and lacks the complexities that are most often attributed to pain and evil impulses. However, the narrator insists that the people of Omelas lead complex lives. The people may lack certain things that others have, but they do not feel that lack as a deprivation. These people have come to an understanding of what is necessary, what is destructive, and what is both or neither. Those things that are necessary, they have. Those luxuries that are neither necessary nor destructive, they also have. Omelas is a joyful city inhabited by mature, intelligent, passionate adults. Their lives are not wretched, nor are they puritanical. This picture of Omelas is not the whole story. There is something that makes the city special in another way. The city has a guarantee of happiness; it has struck a bargain, although how and with whom it is not clear. The bargain is this: In a room under the city is a stunted, frightened, half-starved child, and everyone over adolescence in Omelas knows that the child is there. The child is locked in a closet and shown off to those who wish to see it. It is fed half a bowl of cornmeal mush a day and is left to sit, naked, in dirt and its own excrement. The child barely talks, except for a bit of whining gibberish and a plea, heard less and less often, to be let out. No one is allowed to speak even a kind word to the child, and no one stays with it long. If the child were rescued from its cell-like closet, the whole of the city of Omelas would falter. The city’s great happiness, its splendors and health, its architecture, music, and science, all are dependent on the misery of this one child. The Omelas people know that if the child were released, then the possible happiness of the degraded child—and it is only possible, not probable—would be set against the sure failure of the happiness of the many. Thus, the people have been taught compassion and the terrible reality of justice, and on this they base their lives. Inexplicably, there are some young people, and sometimes even an adult, who, shortly after viewing the child, leave Omelas through its gates and head into the mountains. They do not return.

### Themes

- In **Reunion** by **John Cheever**, the most prominant theme is **disappointment**. The story is a sad account of a failure to reunite to a loved person by the failure of that loved person's ability to **learn from mistakes**. The story makes use of father's **dysfunctional masculinity and intellectualism** to exhibit the arbitrariness of identity in the face of real connection. In the end, by using the train station as both a start and an end, author displays the **temporary quality** of family relations in modern life. 
- In **The Necklace** by **Guy de Maupassant**, the driving theme is **being materialistic**. This is a moral story about an event that caused the economical downfall of a couple because of one's obsession of the necklace in the title. The story, in the end, make it very clear that **material wealth is an illusion** because that one person thought the jewelery was valuable, whereas, in fact, it was not.
- In **The Lady with the Pet Dog** by **Anton Chekhov**, a prominent theme is **dissatisfaction with life**. Both of them, the lady and the man, connects to each other through this dissatisfaction. An other prominent theme is that, **through adultery**, Gurov **finding** **his morality**. This is very unexpected in the time this story was written. Altough Gurov is introduced as a womanizer, he doesn't seem so disrespectful to Anna because he actually cares for her. And another theme would be **isolation** because of the fact that even the readers are isolated from the story, as Anna from Gurov and from her own life, and Gurov from pretty much everything. They can not simply get together because of consequences.
- In **Kew Gardens** by **Virginia Woolf**, one of the main themes is **isolation**, as it can be clearly seen by the first wanderers in the park. The husband, seemingly, talks with his wife about a marriage proposal he made to an another person, only to realize that he is just imagining this conversation. One of the reasons of this isolation is the **advancements in society**, as it can been by the fact that they are walking around in a "park" rather than just around. This is an urban setting and alienation is very much trending already. Two woman speak to each other without a solid context, a man is clearly insane, and there is a snail whose problems are not even recognized by humans. All of their realities are for themselves. The story portrays the scenes as if **there is no common reality**.
- In **That Evening Sun** by **William Faulkner**, **subjective reality** is the most prominent theme. As it is pointed out, the story is told aligned to what the narrator "remembers." Not the acutal reality. Apart from that, the town of Jefferson is seperated into two, one for blacks and one for whites, and for their own realities. White family is incapable of recognizing **the fear** Nancy goes through. The children are never able to recognize any other realities other than their own. 
- In **Muscle Memory** by **Katherine Karlin**, there are themes such as **trauma**, **healing**, **music**, and **skills**. The story makes use of **skill-learning and participation to a culture as a coping mechanism**. There is subjectiveness in reality also, although everyone survived the same catastrophe. The mother is obsessed with being prepared in case of another catastrophe, Augustin is obsessed with his ex-persona as a famous musician, and Destiny with her ambition to be self-sufficient person. The story portrays people's coping mechanisms after a life-changing event.
- In **The Fall of House Usher** by **Edgar Allan Poe**, the most prominent theme is **fear**, as it is so prominent that Roderics Usher actually **fear fear**. Another one is **reality** again. The Usher family is isolated -incestiously isolated- that they decide on their reality themselves. Because of this his **fear actually becomes the reality** in the house of Usher thus rendering the ending as a **self-fulfilled prophecy**.
- In **A Scandal in Bohemia** by **Arthur Conan Doyle**, the one of the most prominent themes is **rationality**. It actually manifests the reader's (middle class) outlook on life. The mind of Holmes is actually a circle-jerk between Dr. Watson and all the readers. Sherlock Holmes is the invisible hand that fixes Western society's problems where rationality (Dr. Watson, readers, and the police) is not enough.
- In **Light is Like Water** by **Gabriel Garcia Marquez**, the most prominent theme is **irrationalty** or magic used against Westerner's rational outlook on life. In its universe, contrary to the values of West, **real & magical** exists hand in hand. 
- In **The Rememberer** by **Aimee Bender**, again, the most prominent theme is **irrationality**. The protagonist seems not to mind the fact enough that her boyfriend is evolving backwards. She is unhappy about it, but it doesn't shatter her reality too much to stop her from going to work everyday.
- In **The Aquatic Uncle** by **Italo Calvano**, altough there is some **irrationality** going on yet again, the main theme is actually **subjectiveness of reality**. Everyone excepy Lll are so obsessed by their reality that they stubbornly argue with each other whether it is good or bad to live on Earth or in the sea. But Lll, from a completely different reality, is in the mindset that enables her to change her environment from land to sea.
- In **All Summer in a Day** by **Ray Bradbury**,  there is fair bit of **isolation** going on. First of all, contary to other students, Margot is from Earth and experienced fully the sun. This difference in her background causes other children to bully her. Another theme can be **enlightenment** literally or metaphorically. Because only after the children are exposed the sun (a.k.a. the light) they come to realize the bad act they've commited.
- In **Half a Day** by **Naguip Mahrouz**, the obvious theme in this story is **life as it is experienced in the end**. The protagonist goes through being **I** to **We** and then again **I**. There is also a lot of **modernization, urbanization** going on while affecting people negatively, contrary to what is expected, and similarity to Kew Gardens in this case. In another case, though, similarity to the Magical Realism is observable because of the attitude against the Westernization happening in Egypt.
- In **The Ones Who Walk Away from the Omelas** by **Ursula K. LeGuin**, themes can be listed as **happiness**, **individual vs. society**, and very obviously **appearance vs. reality**. In Omelas, society's happiness depends on one child's suffering. Thus making happiness a very questionable value. Also, the other aspect is the ones who walk away. The statement that ones who walk away seem to know where they are going signifies **the act of not doing wrong can be superior to happiness**.
