###### “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost

```
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,	// Theme: Life Decisions
And sorry I could not travel both		// Metaphor: "Road" as a life decision
And be one traveler, long I stood		// Tone: Meditative, solitude
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
```

##### Tone and Poetic Line (Lineation)

1. Are lines enjambed or not? Is there any enjambment in the poem? Do you see any run-on lines?
2. What is the length of the lines? Short / long lines?
3. Is there regular / irregular line pattern?
4. If the lines are irregular, do you observe any connection to the content (*i.e.* short lines expressing common idea or indicating interruption. See the poem "Belfast Confetti" as a good example)
5. Is there a stanza break?
6. Is the poem metered, and if the lines are regular is it because of the use of meter?
7. How is lineation / line organization connected to the content of the poem?

what if I die

I have to learn how to dance   		// Tone: anxiety, worrisome

suppose I die before graduation   
they will sing sad melodies

tell the truth about me
There is nothing I want to do

###### "To a Daughter Leaving Home" by Linda Pastan

path of the park,
I kept waiting
for the thud
of your crash as I
sprinted to catch up,
while you grew
smaller, more breakable
with distance,
pumping, pumping
for your life, screaming
with laughter,
the hair flapping
behind you like a
handkerchief waving
goodbye.

###### "Birch Canoe" by Carter Revard

```
Red men embraced     my body's whiteness,			// Metaphor: Full of metaphors 
cutting into me     carved it free,					//

at home in the fish's     fallen heaven.

###### "Summer Day" by Mary Oliver

```
Who made the world?
Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper, I mean--
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down --
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields
which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done?
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
With your one wild and precious life?
```



##### Word Choice

###### "Those Winter Sundays" by Robert Hayden

```
Sundays too my father got up early					// Theme: parental sacrifice
and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,		// 
then with cracked hands that ached	// cacophony here
from labor in the weekday weather made	
banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.

I’d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.
When the rooms were warm, he’d call,
and slowly I would rise and dress,
fearing the chronic angers of that house,

Speaking indifferently to him,
who had driven out the cold
and polished my good shoes as well.
What did I know, what did I know
of love’s austere and lonely offices?
```

##### Syntax and Structure

###### "Belfast Confetti" by Ciaran Carson

```
Suddenly as the riot squad moved in it was raining exclamation
      marks,
Nuts, bolts, nails, car-keys. A fount of broken type. And
      the explosion
Itself – an asterisk on the map. This hyphenated line, a burst
      of rapid fire…
I was trying to complete a sentence in my head, but it kept
      stuttering,
All the alleyways and side streets blocked with stops and
      colons.

I know this labyrinth so well – Balaklava, Raglan, Inkerman,
      Odessa Street –
Why can’t I escape? Every move is punctuated. Crimea Street.
      Dead end again.
A Saracen, Kremlin-2 mesh. Makrolon face-shields. Walkie-
      talkies. What is
My name? Where am I coming from? Where am I going?
      A fusillade of question-marks.
```

###### "Four Trees" by Emily Dickinson

Four Trees — upon a solitary Acre —

The Sun — upon a Morning meets them —
The Wind —

But God —

###### "Tiger Tiger" by William Blake

```
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

When the stars threw down their spears
And water’d heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger Tyger burning bright,
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
```

###### "Between Walls" by William Carlos Williams

```
the back wings
of the

hospital where
nothing

will grow lie
cinders

in which shine
the broken

pieces of a green
bottle

### Verse Forms

#### The Sonnet

- Love, implicit sexuality, art

- Addressed to lover

- Use of paradox and contradictions

- Focus on physical and psychological state

  ---

- While writing a sonnet, can a poet be creative? Would they not feel confined to the restrictive rules of the sonnet form?

###### "Amoretti LXVII: Like as a Huntsman" by Edmund Spenser

```
Like as a huntsman after weary chase,				a	First Quatrain 
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,				b
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,			a
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:			b
So after long pursuit and vain assay,				b	Second Quatrain
When I all weary had the chase forsook,				c
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,			b						Spenserian
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.	c						Sonnet
There she beholding me with milder look,			c	Third Quatrain
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:		d
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,			c
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.			d
Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,	e	Couplet
So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.			e

###### "Sonnet 18: Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day?" by Shakespeare

```
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?				a	1st Qt.			iambic pentameter
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:			b			
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,		a
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;		b
Sometime too hot an eye of heaven shines,			c	2nd Qt.
And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;			d
And every fair from fair sometimes declines,		c
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;	d
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,				e	3rd Qt.
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;		f
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,	e
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:			f
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,			g	Couplet | Volta: turn in logic,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.	g			| emphasis, reflection
```

###### "Sonnet 73: That time of year thou mayst in me behold" by Shakespeare

```
That time of year thou mayst in me behold				a
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang			b
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,			a
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	b
In me thou seest the twilight of such day				c
As after sunset fadeth in the west;						d
Which by and by black night doth take away,				c
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.			d
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,				e
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,				f
As the death-bed whereon it must expire					e
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.			f
This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,	g
To love that well which thou must leave ere long. 		g
```

###### "Leda and the Swan" by William Butler Yeats

```
A sudden blow: the great wings beating still 		a
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed 		b
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, 		a
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. 		b
How can those terrified vague fingers push 			c
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs? 		d
And how can body, laid in that white rush, 			c
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? 	d
A shudder in the loins engenders there 				e
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower			f
And Agamemnon dead. 
			Being so caught up, 					g
So mastered by the brute blood of the air, 			e
Did she put on his knowledge with his power			f 
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop? 	g
