- Most modern poetry is lyric. They turned inwards. 

- Analysis:

  - There is usually a speaker (also called a persona). 
    - Try to find out the tone of the speaker. This might be serious, sarcastic, humorous, sad, melancholic, happy, hopeful etc.
    - There is usually erasure of persona in imagist poetry.

  - In some cases lineation is everything. This is organization of lines, art of lining (deciding where the line ends.)

    - Stanza break?

    - Short-long lines. Regular-irregular lines. Is there a pattern to this?

    - In some lines, there is **enjambment **(run-on lines). If line ends without incomplete meaning then the line is enjambed.

      > how come my knees are	:arrow_right: this is enjambment
      >
      > always so ashy 			:arrow_right: completes the meaning

### Sound and Rhythm in Poetry

- Poetry began as sound.
- Today we read poetry, but initially it was meant to be heard.
- Poetry had more sound effects formerly than it has today.
- Review the oldest categorization of poetry:
  - Narrative
  - Dramatic
  - Lyric
- 3 points to consider while analyzing sound and rhythm in poetry:
  - **Sound Effects** Alliteration, assonance, cacophony, and euphony
  - **Rhyme**
  - **Meter**: iambic trimeter, tetrameter, pentameter

### Death and the Maiden

`Chile, Pinochet, Exile, US intervention`

**Ariel Dorfman** (1942-) was born in Argentine and lived in Chile then was sent into exile.

In 1970, Salvador Allende, was the first socialist president elected in Western Hemisphere under *Unidad Popular* which was a coalition of six socialist parties. US tried to overthrow him, because of the negotiations with Cuba which was embargoed by the US. As a consequence, in 1973, Pinochet gets to control the country, via a military coup in which Allende dies along with many Chileans. During the coup, Paulina is tortured. 

Does the play make audience side with Pauline?
