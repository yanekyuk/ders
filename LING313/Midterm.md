### Phonetic

- Turkish makes use of **pulmonic egressive air system**.

#### Consonants

1. **State of the Glottis** corresponds to voicedness. When it is completely open there are no vibrations, thus no voicing. When it gets closer, vibrations add up, resulting in voicing.  [p :arrow_right: b, t :arrow_right: d, s :arrow_right: z]

2. **Movement of the velum** corresponds to nasality. When it is rested on pharyngial wall, it stops the air from going into nasal cavity, causing the voice to be oral. If it is raised and allowing air to go into nasal cavity, it causes the sound to be nasal.

   > Aspiration in Turkish. <pil> :arrow_right: [pʰil], <ip> [ipʰ], <iplik> [iplik]

3. **Point of articulation** corresponds to the latest articulator in oral cavity. It consists of *bilabial*, *dental*, *alveolar*, *palatal*, *velar*…

4. **Manner of articulation** corresponds to the degree of stricture in the production of the sound.

   1. **Stop**: air is stopped completely to free it all in an instance. `[ p t m t d n k g ]`
   2. **Affricate**: A stop followed by a fricative.
   3. **Fricative**: air is constricted to create friction. It's continuous.  
   4. **Tap/Flap**: A quick constriction that is difficult to observe.
   5. **Approximant**: Almost vowels.

- **Minimal Pairs**: Where there is only one phoneme that changes the meaning of a lexical item.

- **Contrastive Pair**: Where there is more than one phoneme (because it is hard to find an example) that changes the meaning of a word.

- **Complementary Distribution**: Where a change in phoneme doesn't change the meaning of a lexicon. If this is true, the phonemes in question are **allophones**.

  - **Underlying Phoneme**: When one of the allophones has more enviroment than the other:

    > /pʰ/ has more enviroment than /p/. Therefore /pʰ/ is the **underlying phoneme**.
    >
    > /pʰ/ → [p] / ___C
